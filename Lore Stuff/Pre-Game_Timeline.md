# 📅 Pre-Game Timeline

*A record of events leading to the Knox County collapse — July 9, 1993.*

---

## 🌍 1989 – 1990 — "The Origin"

**Global Context:** Minor, bizarre news stories circulated regarding violent "flesh-eating" riots in Libya (1989) and Raleigh, NC (1990).

**Public Perception:** These were widely dismissed as mass hysteria, rabies outbreaks, or tabloid exaggeration. Most people have forgotten them, though conspiracy theorists — and tabloids — occasionally reference them.

## 🌡️ June 1993 — "The Shift"

**The Knox Odor:** For the entire month of June, residents of Muldraugh, West Point, and surrounding areas complained of a distinct, metallic, and sulfurous smell.

**The Explanation:** Local authorities and media attributed this to industrial runoff, heat-wave induced sewage issues, or fertilizer.

**Livestock Issues:** Farmers in rural Kentucky reported an unusually high mortality rate among cattle and pigs, officially blamed on a standard agricultural disease.

## 📵 July 1, 1993 — "The Silence"

**The Blackout:** At approximately 6:00 AM, all telephone landlines within the designated Knox County area ceased functioning.

**Official Statement:** Knox Telecommunications released a statement citing "critical unscheduled maintenance" caused by the extreme summer heat melting older infrastructure.

**Impact:** No calls could go in or out of the affected towns.

## 🤒 July 2 – July 3, 1993 — "The Sickness"

**The "Summer Flu":** Reports leaked — via travelers before the blockade — of a severe flu strain hitting Muldraugh and West Point.

**Symptoms:** High fever, profuse sweating, extreme anxiety, and fainting.

**Labor Shortage:** Major local employers (McCoy Logging, Spiffo's, and public services) experienced massive staff call-outs due to illness.

---

## 🎆 July 4, 1993 — Independence Day

**The Event:** During holiday celebrations, emergency services were overwhelmed. The number of "fainting" victims spiked drastically.

**Civil Unrest:** Fights broke out in emergency rooms and crowded public spaces. Police scanners — for those listening — reported "violent psychosis" among patients.

---

## 🚧 July 6, 1993 — The Exclusion Zone

**The Blockade:** The US military (Army and National Guard) formally established a perimeter around Muldraugh, West Point, Dixie Mobile Park, and the surrounding countryside.

**The Official Narrative:** The government announced a "Containment Zone" to manage a domestic terror threat or biological hazard. The official stance was that the situation was "under control."

---

## ✈️ July 7, 1993 — The No-Fly Zone

**Air Traffic:** The FAA grounded all civilian air traffic over Kentucky.

**Media Blackout:** News vans and reporters were turned away at the military blockades. Information coming out of the zone was restricted to official government press releases, which became increasingly vague.

---

## 📻 July 8, 1993 — The Panic

**Rumors:** Despite the blackout, word began to spread via shortwave radio and individuals who fled through the woods — the "sick" were attacking people, and the dead were not staying dead.

**National Reaction:** Widespread confusion. The President is expected to address the nation, but the government maintains the narrative of a "quarantine."

## ☣️ July 9, 1993 — The Collapse *(Game Start)*

**Status:** The Exclusion Zone is fully sealed.

**Inside the Zone:** Law enforcement has effectively dissolved. Looting is rampant. The infection rate has hit critical mass.

**Outside the Zone:** The world watches and waits, believing the Army has the situation contained within the Kentucky border.
