Subject: THE METEORS ARE A SIGNAL

Is anyone else watching the sky over Kentucky? The news keeps talking about the "Perseid-B" shower being a beautiful natural phenomenon. They are lying. I’ve been tracking atmospheric entry vectors since the 80s. These rocks aren't burning up right. The ionization trail is purple, not orange.

Do you remember Varginha, Brazil last year? The "gas leak" story? My cousin in Rio said the exact same purple streaks were in the sky two days before the military locked down the favelas.

I’m in a motel just outside West Point right now. The smell here is unbearable—sulfur and copper. And the "Summer Flu"? It’s not flu. I saw a man collapse at the gas station today. He didn't cough. He just... stopped.

The phones are dead. The highway is blocked by guys in hazmat suits who aren't wearing insignias. I think the rocks brought something with them. Or maybe they just woke something up.
If you’re in Knox County, get out. If you can’t get out, hide.

You guys are actually buying the official story?

I’ve been monitoring the police bands since the blockade went up on the 6th. Triple-N and WBLN are running that story claiming the leaked dispatch recordings are "elaborate pranks" or "pirate radio interference."

Bullshit.

I recorded this off the Rosewood frequency yesterday morning before they encrypted the channel. This isn't a prank. You can hear the dispatcher panicking.

Pay attention to the timeline. The subject didn't have the "flu." He fell down the stairs. He died from a broken neck.

And then he got up.

They aren't quarantining sick people, folks. They are quarantining death itself.

[04:12:08] CALLER: (Female, distressed, heavy breathing) It’s my husband. It’s Frank. He fell down the stairs. I think... I think his neck broke. He’s not moving.

[04:12:15] DISPATCH: Ma’am, stay calm. Units are tied up with the riots in West Point. Is he breathing?

[04:12:22] CALLER: No. No, he’s cold. He’s been dead for ten minutes. I’m just sitting here waiting for the coroner but the phones were down and— (Audio peaks: Screaming)

[04:12:30] DISPATCH: Ma’am? What’s happening?

[04:12:33] CALLER: HE MOVED! FRANK! OH GOD, FRANK, YOUR NECK IS SIDEWAYS!

[04:12:38] DISPATCH: Ma’am, get away from the body. Listen to me, get away from—

[04:12:41] CALLER: (Sounds of wet tearing / Choking) HE’S EATING ME! HE’S DEAD AND HE’S EATING ME!

User Comment:
If you are in the zone, DO NOT TRUST THE "ALL CLEAR." If someone dies—heart attack, stroke, accident, it doesn't matter—get away from them.

** WARNING: THIS THREAD IS BEING MONITORIED. DOWNLOAD AND ARCHIVE IMMEDIATELY. **

I am seeing a lot of new users flooding the board asking about the "riots" in Muldraugh. Stop listening to CNN. Stop listening to the Army. We have seen this script before.

Does the name "Raleigh EVNA" mean anything to you?

In 1990, a "biotech lab leak" in North Carolina was blamed for a localized outbreak of "aggressive psychosis." The official story was a gas leak combined with mass hysteria. They scrubbed the papers. They silenced the witnesses.

But I kept the logs.

I am re-uploading the RALEIGH_90_MANIFEST.TXT file. Compare the symptoms from the 1990 incident to what callers are describing in Knox County right now:

The Smell: Raleigh residents reported a "copper/sulfur" stench three weeks before the violence. (Confirmed in Knox, June '93).

The "Flu": High fever, sweating, aversion to water/light. (Confirmed in Knox, July '93).

The Violence: Subjects do not just get sick; they attack. Specifically biting.

THE CONNECTION:
The lab in Raleigh was a subsidiary of K.N.O.X. Telecommunications. The same company that owns the "relay station" in the exclusion zone right now.

This isn't a new disease, folks. It’s a field test. Raleigh was Phase 1. Brazil ('92) was Phase 2. Kentucky is Phase 3.

They are trying to see if they can control it. Based on the reports I’m hearing about the blockade shooting civilians on I-65... I think they lost control.

Subject: TRANSLATION: The 1979 Sverdlovsk "Anthrax" Leak (IT MATCHES)
From: Red_Dossier
Newsgroups: soc.culture.soviet, alt.conspiracy.coldwar

We all know the official story of the Sverdlovsk Incident (1979). The Soviets claimed a military facility accidentally released anthrax spores. 64 people died. The West accepted it because it made the commies look incompetent.

But I’ve been translating the Mitrokhin Archive leaks, and I found a field report from a frantic GRU officer dated April 4, 1979. I’ve translated the relevant section below. Tell me if this sounds like "Anthrax" to you.

----------------------------------------------

// TRANSLATED DOCUMENT: COMPOUND 19 //
// CLEARANCE: LEVEL 5 (PURGE AFTER READING) //

"The containment breach of Sample T-08 (Source: Tunguska Crater) is catastrophic. The ceramic filters failed."

"Victims are not displaying symptoms of Bacillus anthracis. There is no respiratory collapse. Instead, subjects exhibit extreme aggression post-mortem. NOTE: 'Post-mortem' designation is difficult to apply. Captain Volkov was confirmed dead at 0900 hours via cranial trauma. At 0915 hours, he attacked the medical staff."

"The targets do not stop when shot in the torso. They only stop when the brain stem is severed."

"The sky above the facility has taken on a peculiar violet hue, similar to the descriptions in the 1908 Tunguska logbooks. The sample is reacting to the atmosphere."

----------------------------------------------

"Sample T-08." Tunguska. 1908.
The Tunguska event wasn't just a meteor explosion. It was a delivery system.

The Soviets spent 70 years trying to weaponize whatever they found in that crater. In '79, it got out. They covered it up by claiming it was Anthrax and sealing the city.

Now, look at the weather reports for Kentucky tonight. "Purple atmospheric ionization" from the meteor shower.

The Russians dug it up. We must have found another piece of it. And now it’s waking up.
