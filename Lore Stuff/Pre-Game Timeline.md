- 1989 – 1990: "The Origin"

 - Global Context: Minor, bizarre news stories circulated regarding violent "flesh-eating" riots in Libya (1989) and Raleigh, NC (1990).

 - Public Perception: These were widely dismissed as mass hysteria, rabies outbreaks, or tabloid exaggeration. Most people have forgotten them, though conspiracy theorists (and tabloids) occasionally reference them.

- June 1993: "The Shift"
 - The "Knox Odor": For the entire month of June, residents of Muldraugh, West Point, and surrounding areas complained of a distinct, metallic, and sulfurous smell.

 - The Explanation: Local authorities and media attributed this to industrial runoff, heat-wave induced sewage issues, or fertilizer.
Livestock Issues: Farmers in rural Kentucky reported an unusually high mortality rate among cattle and pigs, officially blamed on a standard agricultural disease.

- July 1, 1993: "The Silence"
 - The Blackout: At approximately 6:00 AM, all telephone landlines within the designated Knox County area ceased functioning.

 - Official Statement: Knox Telecommunications released a statement citing "critical unscheduled maintenance" caused by the extreme summer heat melting older infrastructure.
Impact: No calls could go in or out of the affected towns.

- July 2 – July 3, 1993: "The Sickness"

 - The "Summer Flu": Reports leaked (via travelers before the blockade) of a severe flu strain hitting Muldraugh and West Point.
Symptoms: High fever, profuse sweating, extreme anxiety, and fainting.

 - Labor Shortage: Major local employers (McCoy Logging, Spiffo’s, and public services) experienced massive staff call-outs due to illness.

- July 4, 1993: Independence Day

 - The Event: During holiday celebrations, emergency services were overwhelmed. The number of "fainting" victims spiked drastically.

 - Civil Unrest: Fights broke out in emergency rooms and crowded public spaces. Police scanners (for those listening) reported "violent psychosis" among patients.

 - July 6, 1993: The Exclusion Zone

 - The Blockade: The US military (Army and National Guard) formally established a perimeter around Muldraugh, West Point, Dixie Mobile Park, and the surrounding countryside.

 - The Official Narrative: The government announced a "Containment Zone" was established to manage a domestic terror threat or biological hazard. The official stance was that the situation was "under control."

- July 7, 1993: The No-Fly Zone

 - Air Traffic: The FAA grounded all civilian air traffic over Kentucky.

 - Media Blackout: News vans and reporters were turned away at the military blockades. Information coming out of the zone was restricted to official government press releases, which became increasingly vague.

- July 8, 1993: The Panic

 - Rumors: Despite the blackout, word began to spread via shortwave radio and individuals who fled through the woods that the "sick" were attacking people and that the dead were not staying dead.

 - National Reaction: Widespread confusion. The President is expected to address the nation, but the government maintains the narrative of a "quarantine."

- July 9, 1993: The Collapse (Game Start)

 - Status: The Exclusion Zone is fully sealed.
Inside the Zone: Law enforcement has effectively dissolved. Looting is rampant. The infection rate has hit critical mass.

 - Outside the Zone: The world watches and waits, believing the Army has the situation contained within the Kentucky border.
