## ☄️ June 30, 1908 — The Tunguska Event

An explosion over the Tunguska River basin in Siberia flattened approximately 80 million trees across 830 square miles. No impact crater was ever found. The official explanation — an airburst from a comet or asteroid fragment — was accepted by the scientific mainstream.

Soviet recovery teams found something in the crater site. What they recovered was catalogued internally as **Sample T-08** (Source: Tunguska Crater). Logbooks from the 1908 expedition described a "peculiar violet hue" in the sky above the impact zone. The sample was transferred to military custody and studied for decades.

## ☢️ April 1979 — The Sverdlovsk Incident

A containment breach occurred at **Compound 19**, a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). The official story — then and now — was an accidental release of anthrax spores. 64 people were reported dead. The West accepted it.

Translated documents from the Mitrokhin Archive leaks tell a different story:

- The breach involved **Sample T-08**. Ceramic containment filters failed.
- Victims did not display anthrax symptoms. Instead, subjects exhibited **extreme aggression post-mortem**.
- A Captain Volkov was confirmed dead at 0900 hours via cranial trauma. At 0915 hours, he attacked medical staff.
- Subjects could not be stopped by torso shots. **Only destruction of the brain stem was effective.**
- The sky above the facility took on a violet hue matching descriptions from the 1908 Tunguska logbooks. The sample appeared to be reacting to the atmosphere.

The Soviets sealed the city, cremated the dead, and maintained the anthrax cover story for the next fourteen years.

## 🇱🇾 1989 — Libya

Reports of violent "flesh-eating" riots surfaced briefly in international media. Details were sparse — the incident was attributed to mass hysteria or a localized rabies outbreak. The story was buried quickly.

Conspiracy theorists later connected it to the pattern.

---

## 🇺🇸 1990 — Raleigh, North Carolina *(Raleigh EVNA)*

A "biotech lab leak" in Raleigh was blamed for a localized outbreak of "aggressive psychosis." The official story was a gas leak combined with mass hysteria. Papers were scrubbed. Witnesses were silenced.

Symptoms matched what would later appear in Knox Country:

| Symptom | Raleigh 1990 |
|---|---|
| The Smell | Copper/sulfur stench, 3 weeks prior to outbreak |
| The "Flu" | High fever, sweating, aversion to water and light |
| The Violence | Subjects attacked — specifically biting |

The lab responsible was a subsidiary of **K.N.O.X. Telecommunications** — the same company that operates the "relay station" near Rosewood, Kentucky.

Former CDC official **Dr. Jeff Galbraithe** was dismissed following the Raleigh outbreak. He would resurface publicly during the Knox Event.

Usenet user Truth_Archive_SysOp would later describe the pattern as deliberate: *"Raleigh was Phase 1. Brazil was Phase 2. Kentucky is Phase 3."*

> *Source: `alt.conspiracy.biological / talk.politics.misc`, July 6, 1993.*

## 🇧🇷 October 1992 — The Varginha Event (Brazil)

A meteor event over Varginha, Brazil was officially described as a minor atmospheric entry — "locally significant" but unremarkable. A gas leak was blamed for disruptions. The military locked down several favelas.

Purple atmospheric streaks were observed in the sky two days before the lockdown — the same spectral signature later identified in the **Perseid-B anomaly**.

A janitor named **Jim**, who worked at the K.N.O.X. Telecommunications facility near Rosewood, later told *The Truth Seeker* tabloid that material from the Brazil event was transported to the Kentucky facility: *"They bring the rocks in at night. Glowing rocks from the Brazil crash. But it's not the rocks you gotta worry about. It's the dust."*

Jim also reported that military working dogs at the base went rabid after sniffing ventilation grates near the labs. The dogs were shot. The dogs kept snapping. They had to be burned.

> *Source: The Truth Seeker (national tabloid), week of June 28, 1993. A handwritten note scrawled on the cover in marker reads: "JIM WAS RIGHT."*

---

## 🔭 Early 1993 — The Perseid-B Anomaly

Observatories worldwide began tracking an unusual meteor cluster designated **Perseid-B**, expected to peak over North America on July 4th. Unlike standard cometary debris, the cluster exhibited a unique spectral signature — heavy ionization trails glowing **purple-green** rather than the typical orange.

Dr. Aris Thorne of the National Observatory noted: the last time atmospheric entry of this specific mineral composition was recorded was over Brazil in October 1992.

The FAA issued a standard advisory for high-altitude interference.

## 🌡️ June 1993 — "The Shift"

**The Knox Odor:** For the entire month of June, residents of Muldraugh, West Point, and surrounding areas complained of a distinct, metallic, and sulfurous smell that seemed to seep into drywall and car upholstery. The smell matched the copper/sulfur stench reported three weeks before the Raleigh incident in 1990.

**The Explanation:** Local authorities and media attributed it to industrial runoff, heat-wave induced sewage issues, or fertilizer.

**Livestock Deaths:** Farmers on the outskirts found cattle dead in the fields — not from predators, but from a sickness that made them thrash and wail before the end. Dogs began acting aggressive and feverish. Unmarked military trucks were seen speeding toward the restricted facility near Rosewood. Rumors spread that soldiers were shooting sick dogs on sight.

**The Water:** Tap water across the region took on a metallic taste. On July 2nd, Mayor West would hold a press conference declaring the supply safe — a "byproduct of extreme heat and higher sulfur concentrations." The Muldraugh Sun reported a **300% increase** in patients at Cortman Medical citing high fevers, confusion, and nausea.

---

## 📵 July 1, 1993 (Thursday) — "The Silence"

At approximately 6:00 AM, all telephone landlines within the designated Knox Country area ceased functioning. Knox Telecommunications released a statement citing "critical unscheduled maintenance" caused by the extreme summer heat melting older infrastructure. No calls could go in or out of the affected towns. An uneasy quiet settled over Knox Country.

---

## 🤒 July 2–3, 1993 (Friday–Saturday) — "The Sickness"

The **"Summer Flu"** hit hard and fast. Reports leaked — via travelers before the blockade — of a severe strain affecting Muldraugh and West Point.

**Symptoms:** High fever, profuse sweating, extreme anxiety, panicked behavior, and fainting.

**Labor Shortage:** By July 3rd, half the shifts at local factories and fast-food joints were empty. Major employers — McCoy Logging, Spiffo's, and public services — experienced massive call-outs. Waiting rooms at Cortman Medical overflowed into parking lots. The smell in the air worsened.

On **July 3rd**, a military truck carrying an unknown hazardous substance crashed just north of **March Ridge**.

---

## 🎆 July 4, 1993 (Sunday) — Independence Day

The celebration that wasn't.

Holiday events were overwhelmed by emergency services. The number of "fainting" victims spiked drastically. The sick were no longer just bedridden — they were violent. Fights broke out in emergency rooms and crowded public spaces. Police scanners reported "violent psychosis" among patients. A spate of dog attacks on farm animals and residents was noted.

Fireworks went off over the Ohio River. They were drowned out by the sound of sirens.

The **Perseid-B meteor shower** peaked overhead, its purple-green trails visible in the night sky.

---

## July 5, 1993 (Monday)

No significant official events. Inside Knox Country, the situation continued to deteriorate.

Usenet posts from users near the zone described the purple atmospheric ionization, the unbearable sulfur-copper smell, and people collapsing without warning. User StarGazer_93, posting from a motel outside West Point, connected the spectral signature to the Varginha event and warned: *"If you're in Knox Country, get out. If you can't get out, hide."*

## 🚧 July 6, 1993 (Tuesday) — The Exclusion Zone

| Time (EDT) | Event |
|---|---|
| 0600 | US military blocks roads in the area of Kentucky nicknamed "Knox Country." No reason given. Areas within the blockade include Muldraugh, West Point, Brandenburg, and Fort Knox itself. |
| 0800 | Usenet user Truth_Archive_SysOp connects the Knox outbreak to Raleigh 1990 and K.N.O.X. Telecommunications. Uploads the `RALEIGH_90_MANIFEST.TXT` file. Warns: *"This isn't a new disease. It's a field test."* |
| 1100 | Military personnel erect fences and checkpoints within the Knox Exclusion Zone. Entrance and exit forbidden. Reports of residents turned away at gunpoint. |
| 1320 | Personnel in hazmat gear seen within the Exclusion Zone. Air activity increases. |
| 1800 | Military clears traffic and members of the public from the perimeter. Some residents sleep in their cars; others walk north along the highway to Louisville. |
| 2300 | Lightning storms over Louisville. No rain reported. |

The Kentucky Herald declared "Illness Outbreak in Muldraugh," reporting dozens of flu-like cases and suspected chemical leaks from local military installations. Calls for outside assistance were met with obfuscation and denials.

The government announced a "Containment Zone" to manage a domestic terror threat or biological hazard. The official stance was that the situation was "under control."

The FAA grounded all civilian air traffic over Kentucky. News vans and reporters were turned away at the blockades. Information coming out of the zone was restricted to official government press releases, which became increasingly vague.

Supply convoys from Louisville stopped running. Inside the zone, soldiers began "requisitioning" from the town. The town was picked clean.

A journal entry recovered from a diner in the zone describes two soldiers discussing the triage tent — an old man who died of a heart attack, flatlined and cold blue for two minutes. **And then he sat up.** The author planned to flee toward Rosewood via back roads that night. The entry ends: *"There is no help coming."*

Word spread via shortwave radio and through individuals who fled the woods. The dead were not staying dead. Triple-N and WBLN dismissed the leaked dispatch recordings as "elaborate pranks." They were not pranks.
