# 📖 The First Weeks

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 9, 1993.*

---

You remember the heat. That is the first thing to come back to you — the stifling, humid blanket of a Kentucky summer in 1993. It was the kind of heat that made the asphalt shimmer and the air sit heavy in your lungs. But looking back, it wasn't just the heat that made the air feel wrong.

## The Stories You Ignored

For years, there had been whispers in the background of American life — stories you read in tabloids or heard from the drunk at the end of the bar. In '89, there were reports of a "flesh-eating" riot in Libya. In '90, a similar madness struck Raleigh, North Carolina.

People blamed it on everything from a bad batch of Spiffo's "Special Sauce" to government bioweapons testing. But those were just stories — distant, frightening, and ultimately ignored as life in Knox County moved on.

## June 1993 — The Smell

Then came June of 1993.

It started with the smell. At first, you blamed the industrial exhaust from Muldraugh or the sewage treatment plants in West Point. It was a foul, chemical stench, sulfurous and metallic, that seemed to seep into the drywall of your home and the upholstery of your car. You drank water from the tap and tasted something metallic, something *off*. You tried to ignore it.

But the animals knew. By late June, farmers on the outskirts were finding their cattle dead in the fields — not from predators, but from a sickness that made them thrash and wail before the end. Then the dogs started acting strange — aggressive, feverish. You remember seeing a neighbor's golden retriever snapping at the air. You remember the unmarked military trucks speeding toward the restricted facility near Rosewood. You remember the rumors that the soldiers weren't just training; they were shooting sick dogs on sight.

## July 1st — The Silence

July 1st brought the silence. Without warning, the phone lines across Knox County went dead. The operator recordings claimed it was "unscheduled maintenance" due to the extreme heat, but you couldn't call your family in Louisville, and they couldn't call you. An uneasy quiet settled over the towns.

## July 3rd — The Summer Flu

Then came the "Summer Flu." It wasn't a normal bug. It hit hard and fast. By July 3rd, half the shifts at the local factories and fast-food joints were empty. People were collapsing with high fevers, panicked anxiety, and nausea. The waiting rooms at Cortman Medical were overflowing, spilling out into the parking lots. The smell in the air got worse.

## July 4th — The Celebration That Wasn't

July 4th was supposed to be a celebration. You remember the fireworks going off over the Ohio River, but they were drowned out by the sound of sirens. The "flu" had changed. The sick were no longer just bedridden; they were violent. In the emergency rooms, patients began attacking nurses. In the streets, people stumbled through the festive crowds, their eyes clouded, their hunger insatiable.

## July 6th — The Truth

By the morning of July 6th, the truth became undeniable. The military hadn't come to save you; they had come to seal you in.

A hard perimeter was established around the entirety of the Knox Exclusion Zone. Roadblocks manned by the US Army and the National Guard appeared on I-65 and every backroad leading out of the county. The orders were clear: **nothing leaves.** Those who tried to run were turned back at gunpoint. Those who didn't turn back were shot.

## July 7th – 8th — The Pressure Cooker

For the last three days, the zone has been a pressure cooker. The government broadcasts from outside the fence claim this is a "containment measure" for a temporary threat.

**They are lying.**

Inside the zone, society has fractured. The police have been overwhelmed. The hospitals are slaughterhouses. Looting began on the 7th, and by the 8th, the screams of your neighbors were the only news you could trust. The sick are walking. The dead are getting up.

## July 9th — Now

It is the morning of July 9th. The power is flickering. The water is still running, but you know better than to drink it. The phone lines are still dead. You are trapped in Knox County, and the world you knew a week ago is gone.

**This is the story of how you died.**
