## ✍️ Personal Journal Entry

> **Date:** July 7, 1993

I've been nursing this same lukewarm coffee for two hours just to stay out of the sun. The AC is dead. The ice machine is dead. The whole town feels like it's holding its breath, waiting for something to break.

Two Army guys came in about twenty minutes ago. They didn't order anything — kitchen's been closed since noon anyway because the staff didn't show up. They sat in the booth right behind me. I don't think they knew I was listening, or maybe they just didn't care anymore.

The younger one, sounded like a kid, was shaking. He kept whispering about "supply lines" being cut. Said the convoys from Louisville stopped running yesterday. No food. No ammo. They're supposed to be "requisitioning" from the town, but the town is picked clean.

But it's what he said next that made my blood run cold.

He was talking about the triage tent. Said he watched an old man die of a heart attack this morning. Not a bite. Not the sickness. Just an old man's heart giving out. The kid said the man was dead — flatlined, cold blue — for two minutes.

**And then he sat up.**

The Sergeant told him to shut up, said it was just a "reaction." But I heard the fear in his voice, too.

If the trucks aren't coming, and the dead aren't staying dead... what are we doing here? I have a quarter tank of gas left. I'm going to try the back roads toward Rosewood tonight. If you find this, don't stay here.

**There is no help coming.**

### ALIENS IN KENTUCKY? DOGS KNOW THE TRUTH!
*Is the government hiding a crashed saucer in the Knox Telecommunications building? One brave whistleblower says YES!*

"They bring the rocks in at night," says *'Jim'*, a janitor who worked at the top-secret facility near Rosewood. "Glowing rocks from the Brazil crash. But it's not the rocks you gotta worry about. It's the dust."

Jim claims that military working dogs at the base began acting "rabid" after sniffing the ventilation grates near the labs. "They shot them," Jim told The Truth Seeker. "They shot the dogs, but the dogs kept snapping. They had to burn them."

Is this just another tall tale? Or is the "bad flu" hitting Muldraugh actually an extraterrestrial virus? Turn to Page 6 for our exclusive guide on *"How to Build a Bunker on a Budget!"*

### A Cosmic Light Show: The Perseid-B Anomaly

Astronomers are calling it a once-in-a-lifetime event. The Perseid-B meteor shower, expected to peak on July 4th, is baffling observatories from Tokyo to London. Unlike standard cometary debris, the Perseid-B cluster exhibits a unique spectral signature — a heavy ionization trail that glows **purple-green** rather than the typical orange.

Dr. Aris Thorne of the National Observatory notes a strange coincidence: *"The last time we recorded atmospheric entry of this specific mineral composition was over Brazil in October of 1992. That event was much smaller, but locally significant."*

While the view should be spectacular, the FAA has issued a standard advisory for high-altitude interference. So, grab your lawn chairs and look up — the universe is putting on a show, and it's closer than you think.

### MAYOR WEST: "THE WATER IS SAFE"
*By Sarah Greene, Staff Writer*

Despite growing anxiety over the metallic taste reported in tap water across the county, Mayor West held a press conference yesterday on the steps of City Hall to assure residents that the municipal supply is secure.

*"The distinct odor and taste are byproducts of the extreme heat wave affecting our reservoir levels, combined with higher sulfur concentrations,"* West stated, wiping sweat from his brow. *"It is unpleasant, but the Health Department confirms it is potable."*

This statement comes amidst a sharp rise in absenteeism at the McCoy Logging facility and local schools, which officials are attributing to a severe strain of "Summer Influenza." Cortman Medical has reported a **300% increase** in patients citing high fevers, confusion, and nausea.

When asked about the unmarked military convoys seen entering the restricted zone near Rosewood, the Mayor declined to comment, stating only that *"The Army is conducting routine readiness drills for the holiday weekend."*
