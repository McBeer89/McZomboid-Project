## ☣️ Knox County, Kentucky — July 9th, 1993

The phones went dead July 1st. The Army sealed the roads on the 6th. By the 9th, the hospitals were gone, the police were gone, and the dead were getting up.

Nobody's calling it what it is. Not yet. But you've smelled the sulfur in the air since June. You've seen the purple streaks in the sky. You know the water's been wrong for weeks.

There's no rescue coming. There never was.

This is a free-form RP server set inside the Knox Exclusion Zone at the moment society collapses. Play it like PvE — but live it like your character.

### 🎭 Player-Driven Narrative

No forced scripts. No rails. You shape what's left of the world. Admins facilitate events and act as background forces — the military, the broadcasts, the silence — but the story is yours.

- **Radio:** Global, faction, and safehouse chat is disabled. There's a global in-game frequency. Use custom frequencies for faction or hidden comms.
- **Strict No-KOS:** We're here to tell stories, not grief. PvP is reserved for narrative conflict. Full rules are in the Discord — read them carefully.
- **Realistic Characters:** Extra creation points so you can build a scared, flawed human being. Not a supersoldier. Not a fantasy. A person trying to last one more day.
