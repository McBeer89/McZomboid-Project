# Chapter Two: Checkpoint Harlan

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 9, 1993. Early evening.*

Reyes had his rifle up before anyone else had processed the movement.

Gary put his arm across Jesse's chest by reflex — the same arm, the same motion as that afternoon, the same answer to a different question. Jesse didn't move. Lily stirred against Diane's shoulder and Diane's hand went to the back of her head, pressing gently, the way you tell someone to stay quiet without making a sound.

The tree line was dark and still for two seconds.

Then a voice came out of it.

"US Army. We're coming out. Four personnel. Weapons down."

Reyes didn't lower his rifle.

"Reyes," Morrow said.

A beat. Then the rifle came down an inch. Not all the way.

They came out in a loose column — four soldiers in the same dull green as Morrow's squad, moving with the careful deliberateness of people who had learned this week that fast movement in open spaces attracted attention. The man in front was young, Gary saw immediately — younger than he looked at first, which was young enough. Upright in the way that came from training and hadn't yet been rounded off by the particular physics of this week. He had his rifle slung and his hands visible and he walked like someone who expected to be in charge of whatever he walked into.

The rank on his collar said he was right about that.

Morrow straightened. Not much. Enough.

"Lieutenant."

"Sergeant." The lieutenant's eyes moved across the group with the quick efficiency of a man doing an inventory. He had done it so fast Gary wasn't sure he'd seen it happen. "Sergeant Morrow?"

"Yes, sir."

"Lieutenant Paul Greer, Fort Knox." He extended his hand. Morrow shook it. "You're attached to the 3rd?"

"Were, sir."

A pause. Something in Greer's face processed that *were* and filed it. "How long have you been on this road."

"Since about eleven hundred."

Greer looked at the truck in the ditch. "Transfer case?"

"Driveshaft too," Cutler said, from nowhere in particular.

Greer nodded slowly, the nod of a man recalculating. His eyes moved back to Gary. To Diane. To the kids. They stayed there a moment longer than they'd stayed anywhere else.

"Civilians," he said.

"Met them on the road about four hours ago," Morrow said. "Their vehicle's a half mile back. They have a location nearby — shelter for the night."

"What location."

Gary answered before Morrow could. "Deer camp. My brother-in-law's. Three-quarters of a mile east, off the road. It's solid."

Greer looked at him the way men looked at civilians when they were deciding how much weight to give them. Gary had been looked at that way before, twenty years ago, and found he had not missed it.

"Your name."

"Gary Hutchins. This is my wife, Diane. My kids."

The lieutenant's eyes went to Diane in a way that wasn't impolite but wasn't casual either — he'd registered something, Gary thought, though he couldn't have said what. Then to Jesse, briefly. Then to Lily asleep on Diane's shoulder, one hand loose around a yellow Walkman, and something moved in Greer's face that he put away quickly.

"Mr. Hutchins." He said it with the slight formality of someone who'd been raised to use it. "You have a usable shelter within three-quarters of a mile."

"Yes."

"You're certain of it."

"I've spent a lot of weekends there."

Greer looked at the sky. The amber had gone to red and the red was going. Gary watched him do the math — the same math Gary had been doing for an hour, the same math everyone who had been outside in Knox County after dark now did automatically, the way you checked the weather before deciding anything.

"All right," Greer said. He said it the way Gary was beginning to understand commands got said out here — not like decisions, but like the last domino in a row that was already falling. He turned back to Morrow. "We move together. Your people fall in with mine. We'll reassess at the shelter."

"Yes, sir."

"Full situation brief when we're inside." His eyes went to Gary again. "You included, Mr. Hutchins. I expect you'll want to hear it."

---

The woman who fell back beside Diane introduced herself as Vasquez. She did it without preamble, the way soldiers did — name, rank, nothing extra — and then she was simply there, matching Diane's pace, Lily still asleep between them like a small fact neither woman was going to disturb.

"ER?" Vasquez said, after a minute.

Diane looked at her.

"The way you're carrying her." Vasquez nodded at Lily. "That's a nurse's carry."

"Cortman Medical. Until the third."

Vasquez made a sound that wasn't quite acknowledgment and wasn't quite anything else. "We've been past Cortman."

Diane waited.

"You don't want to go back."

"I know," Diane said.

They walked in silence for a while. Ahead of them, Gary was moving alongside Morrow in the practiced quiet of two men who understood each other's silences. Behind her, she could hear Shores talking to Jesse in a low voice, and Jesse giving back something brief and flat that wasn't discouragement but wasn't invitation either. Jesse was learning to do that. She didn't know how she felt about it.

"Your lieutenant," Diane said quietly. "Where does he think this ends."

Vasquez was quiet long enough that Diane thought she wasn't going to answer.

"He thinks it ends at Harlan," she said finally. "National Guard armory east of the zone. He has orders that say so."

"And you?"

Another pause. Shorter this time. "I think Harlan is a good place to spend a few days while we figure out what we actually think."

Diane looked at her. Vasquez was looking straight ahead.

"That's fair," Diane said.

---

The deer camp was a low, dark shape set back from a logging road, half-hidden by sweetgum and hickory that had been growing around it long enough to make it look like it had grown there too. One room and a lean-to, plywood over the windows, a porch with a rusted glider and a coffee can full of old nails. It smelled like mildew and motor oil and the particular absence of people who had been away for a while.

Gary found the spare key where it always was — under the third cinderblock from the steps — and had the door open without being asked.

Greer posted Reyes and Cross on the perimeter before anyone went inside. Not because he was asked to, Gary noted. Because it was the right call and he'd already made it. Whatever else was true about the lieutenant, he was not slow.

Inside was low and close and warm — the windows had been shuttered from outside and the air had been sitting for a while. A folding table, four mismatched chairs, a cot against the far wall, a kerosene lamp on the shelf that Gary found by feel and lit after a moment of searching for matches. The light spread in a yellow circle that left the corners dark and made everyone's faces look like a photograph from a long time ago.

Lily woke up when they settled her on the cot. She looked around without moving, taking the new room in with the flat assessment of a child who has learned this week not to wake up alarmed, because alarmed doesn't help and she has understood, somehow, that the adults need her not to be alarmed.

She found Gary's eyes. He nodded once.

She held up the Walkman.

He crossed the room and sat on the edge of the cot and took it from her. He turned it over in his hands. Opened the battery compartment, already knowing what he'd find. He checked his jacket pocket, found one AA rolling loose at the bottom, checked the other side, found a second. He wasn't sure how long they'd last. He put them in and pressed play.

Silence.

Then — faint, warped, barely there — a cassette that had been paused mid-side clicked to life. Something Gary didn't recognise at first, slow and distorted from a tape that had been started and stopped too many times. Then he did recognise it. Lionel Richie. *Hello.* Of all the things.

Lily's eyes closed.

Gary sat there and held the Walkman until she was asleep again, and the song wound down into the hiss of blank tape, and the lamp put its yellow circle on the floor, and outside Reyes was watching the dark.

---

The brief happened at the folding table with the lamp between them. Greer laid it out straight — Gary respected that. No softening, no bureaucratic hedging, just the shape of the thing.

The exclusion zone was sealed and would remain sealed. The order was not going to change. There was no extraction plan for civilians inside the zone. What there was, as of July 6th, was a directive to consolidate military personnel and civilian assets at **Checkpoint Harlan** — a National Guard armory forty miles east of the zone boundary, on a highway interchange in Lincoln County. It had stores. It had communications. It had walls that were worth something.

Getting there meant moving through Knox County, through whatever July 9th Knox County had become, and then through whatever was on the other side of the perimeter. Which meant either finding a gap or creating one.

Greer said this without bravado. He said it like a man listing the contents of a bag he was going to have to carry.

"You said civilian assets," Gary said.

Greer looked at him.

"When you laid it out. Consolidate military personnel and *civilian assets.*"

"That's correct."

"What does that mean to you, practically."

Greer was quiet for a moment. Not because he didn't have an answer, Gary thought, but because he was deciding how much of the answer to give.

"It means that the mission includes you," he said. "Your family. Anyone we encounter in a condition to travel. We are not leaving people."

Gary studied him. Twenty years ago he had served under three different kinds of officer. The kind who said that and meant it. The kind who said it and would revise it under pressure. And the kind who'd never had to find out which kind they were. Greer was the third kind working hard to be the first. The question was whether he'd get the chance.

"The kids," Gary said.

"Travel as part of your family unit."

"The pace."

Greer looked across the table at Vasquez. Something passed between them.

"We make the pace work," he said.

Diane said nothing through any of this. She was watching Greer the way she watched patients — not for what they said but for what they did when they said it. Gary knew that look. He let it work.

---

Later, when the lamp was turned low and most of the room was breathing the slow deep breath of people who had not been still in days, Gary sat on the porch step and looked at the dark between the trees. Morrow came out after a while and stood at the railing.

They hadn't spoken directly since the road.

"You knew," Gary said. Not accusing. Just placing it.

Morrow was quiet.

"About the scratch."

Still quiet.

"She's a nurse," Gary said. "She's known since this afternoon." He paused. "I've known since about ten minutes after that."

Somewhere in the trees, something moved. Neither of them reacted. The sounds you reacted to and the sounds you didn't had already sorted themselves into two categories this week and that one was the second kind.

"It doesn't spread the way people think," Morrow said. Eventually. Quietly.

Gary looked at him.

"I've watched four people turn," Morrow said. "One of them had a bite. Three of them didn't." He said it flatly, the way you said things that you'd had to say to yourself enough times that the saying of them had gone smooth. "It's not the bite that does it. I don't know what does. But it's not the bite."

Gary let that sit.

"You were going to tell the lieutenant."

"I was going to tell the lieutenant when I had more than a theory."

"And now."

Morrow looked at the trees. "Now I have a scratched arm and a theory and a lieutenant with orders that were written before any of this mattered." He turned the sleeve over on his wrist, the gesture of a man who had been making the same gesture all day without deciding anything. "When it becomes relevant, I'll tell him."

"When it becomes relevant," Gary said, "is going to be fast."

Morrow looked at him. Held it.

"Yeah," he said.

Inside, Lily was asleep on the cot with a Walkman on her chest. Jesse was sitting against the wall with his eyes open and his knees up. Hicks was in the corner, and Gary had watched Diane put the back of her wrist to his forehead the way she checked Lily for fever, and he had watched the look on her face when she took it away.

The dark between the trees was just the dark.

For now.
