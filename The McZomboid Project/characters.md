## 🪖 Morrow's Squad

---

### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 38
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Six foot even, built like someone who used to be bigger and has been burning it off from the inside. Dark hair going gray at the temples, cut close. A face that has spent too much time in the sun over too many years — lined around the eyes, rough at the jaw. He moves with the deliberate economy of a man who learned long ago that wasted motion costs something. His left sleeve is rolled down and buttoned at the wrist. It is July in Kentucky. He has not been asked about it.

**History:**
Born in Dothan, Alabama, the second of four kids. His father worked the line at a peanut processing plant; his mother kept the house and the peace. Dale enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available to him and he understood, even then, that he needed structure the way some people need water. He was good at it — good enough to make sergeant by twenty-six, good enough to keep it. He has been stationed at Fort Knox since 1990, which means he knows this county. Or knew it, before the 6th.

He has a daughter in Georgia he calls every Sunday. He has not been able to call since July 1st.

**The Scratch:**
Received the morning of July 8th during a perimeter sweep near West Point. A civilian came out of a house without warning. He put her down. Her fingernails caught the inside of his forearm as she fell — three short lines, nothing that needed stitches. He rolled his sleeve down and kept moving. He has watched four people turn this week. One had a bite. Three didn't. He does not yet know what this means with certainty but he has a theory he is sitting with. He has not told his men. He has now told Gary Hutchins.

**Current Status:**
Falls under Lieutenant Greer's command as of the evening of July 9th. Follows orders. Runs his own arithmetic quietly underneath them.

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, stocky, with hands that always look dirty even when they aren't. Brown hair cut to regulation, a broad flat face that defaults to neutral. Sweats constantly and doesn't seem to notice. Has a habit of wiping his palms on his thighs before touching anything mechanical, like a ritual. Quiet in the way that comes from preferring to listen to engines rather than people.

**History:**
Grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Took his first engine apart at fourteen — a lawn mower, then a neighbor's Buick, then anything that held still long enough. Enlisted because the Army would pay him to do the only thing he was genuinely good at. He is not ideological about service. He does the job. The truck in the ditch on the back road outside Muldraugh is the first job he has not been able to finish, and it has unsettled him more than anything else he has seen this week.

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Slight, sandy-haired, with the open unguarded face of someone who hasn't yet learned to close it. Freckled across the nose and cheeks. A little too much energy in his hands — always picking at something, turning something over, doing something small with his fingers when he's not supposed to be talking. Looks younger than twenty. Has aged about four years in the past week.

**History:**
From Elizabethtown, Kentucky — twenty minutes outside the exclusion zone by highway. His mother and his younger brother are inside it. He hasn't told Morrow this because he doesn't know what Morrow would do with the information. Enlisted eight months ago. This is his first posting. He was supposed to go home for his mother's birthday on July 12th.

He fills silence because the silence, lately, has sounds in it.

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, designated marksman

**Physical Description:**
Lean and dark, with close-cropped black hair and eyes that don't settle. Not tall, but he takes up a considered amount of space — the posture of someone who has decided exactly how much of the world he will occupy and holds that line. A scar along the left side of his jaw from before the Army; he has never explained it and no one asks twice. Almost always at the edge of wherever the group is.

**History:**
Grew up in San Antonio, the son of a retired Army staff sergeant. Joined because it was expected, stayed because it suited him. Two prior deployments — Panama, '89, and a brief unremarked assignment in '91 that he does not discuss. He has seen things end badly before. He has learned to position himself so that when they do, he is already facing the right direction.

What he saw on the road from West Point on July 8th confirmed something he had been building since July 4th. He has not shared it. He will share it when he decides sharing it is useful.

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Tall and angular, with a long neck and eyes set a little too far apart. Still has the look of someone who hasn't finished growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, follows where he's pointed. Tends to stand half a step behind whoever is nearest to him.

**History:**
From rural Indiana. Graduated high school in May, enlisted in June, arrived at Fort Knox with forty-eight hours to spare before the phones went dead. Has been in-country, so to speak, for his entire military career. Does what he's told because he has not yet learned to do otherwise.

---

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium build going soft, dark circles under his eyes, a pallor his tan is losing the argument against. Sits apart from the group with his knees drawn up. Occasionally presses the back of his hand to his forehead in a way that looks like habit — checking for something he doesn't want to find.

**History:**
From Memphis. Third year of service, no particular distinction. Has a girlfriend he writes letters to that he has not mailed in two weeks. Has been running a low fever since July 7th. Has not told Morrow.

**Current Status:**
Diane checked his temperature at the deer camp on the night of July 9th. Her face when she took her wrist away did not look like nothing.

## 🪖 Greer's Unit

---

### First Lieutenant Paul Greer
**Age:** 27
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11A Infantry Officer

**Physical Description:**
Medium height and lean, with the upright bearing of someone who earned it through ROTC and has maintained it through conviction rather than habit. Brown hair, regulation cut. A face that is still young enough to be readable — he hasn't learned yet to make it blank, which means you can see him processing things if you watch closely. Clean-shaven even now, which Gary Hutchins finds either admirable or troubling depending on the moment. Carries himself like a man who believes the situation is manageable, which is different from a man who knows it is.

**History:**
Grew up in Cincinnati, the son of a city planner and a high school history teacher. Eagle Scout. ROTC scholarship at Ohio State, commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1989, promoted to first lieutenant eighteen months ago. Has served at Fort Knox since 1991. This is the first assignment of his career that has required him to make decisions not covered somewhere in his training, and he is meeting that fact by treating it as an anomaly rather than a new condition. He is not stupid. He is operating on the assumption that the framework holds because he has not yet seen enough of it failing to fully update that assumption.

He believes in the mission. He believes in his orders. He believes that Checkpoint Harlan is the right answer and that getting this group there is the right thing to do. He is correct about the last part. Whether he is correct about the rest remains to be seen.

**The Two Missing Soldiers:**
Greer's unit arrived at the back road with four men. It departed Fort Knox with six. He has not discussed this. If asked, he will give a factual account in a flat voice and move on immediately. What that account contains, and what it cost him, is something the story will eventually answer.

**Notes:**
The most dangerous thing about Greer is not inflexibility — he can adapt tactically and does so quickly. The dangerous thing is that his moral framework and his institutional framework are currently identical, and the moment they diverge he will not be prepared for it.

### Sergeant First Class Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 34
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, senior NCO

**Physical Description:**
Compact and direct, with dark hair pulled back tight and the kind of face that gives away exactly as much as it intends to and no more. Brown eyes that move constantly in the way of someone who has made a habit of knowing where everything is. A small scar on her right hand, old knuckles, that she doesn't explain. Moves efficiently without telegraphing where she's going. Does not fill silence.

**History:**
Grew up in El Paso. Enlisted at nineteen, has been in for fifteen years, has seen enough of the Army to understand the distance between what it says it does and what it does. She is good at her job and she knows it, which gives her a quiet authority that operates in parallel to the official chain of command. She followed Greer here because his orders made sense when they were issued. She will continue following them until they stop making sense, at which point she will have a direct, private conversation with him before deciding anything else.

She understood the situation with Hicks inside two minutes of entering the deer camp. She and Diane Hutchins will have a conversation about it before morning.

**Notes:**
Vasquez is the clearest thinker in the combined group. She is also the most patient, which is not the same thing as passive. She has been watching everything since she emerged from the tree line and has formed opinions she is not sharing yet.

---

### Specialist Darnell Cross
**Age:** 23
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Broad-shouldered and unhurried, with a stillness about him that reads as confidence and probably is. Close-cropped hair, a wide face that defaults to neutral attention. Carries his equipment without apparent effort. Has a habit of checking his bootlaces before moving — always the left one first.

**History:**
From Atlanta, the middle of five kids. Enlisted because his older brother did and because the alternatives at twenty were less interesting. Has been in for three years and has made no enemies and several quiet friends. Is not complicated in ways that create problems.

**Notes:**
Cross is steady. In a group this size that is not a small thing. He will become important at a moment when steadiness is the scarcest resource available.

---

### Private First Class Owen Briggs
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, fair-skinned, with blond hair that looks bleached by sun even when it isn't. Would have a pleasant face in other circumstances. Currently has the particular flatness of expression that comes from having seen something that has not finished processing. His eyes are present but occasionally go somewhere else briefly — a half-second at a time, like a signal dropping.

**History:**
From a small town in western Pennsylvania, the son of a mechanic. Enlisted at nineteen. Was in the same unit as the two soldiers who are no longer with Greer's column. Was present for whatever happened to them. Has not been asked to describe it and has not volunteered.

**Notes:**
Briggs is functional. Whether he remains so depends on what the story asks of him. Jesse Hutchins has noticed the way his eyes go somewhere else, recognizes the mechanism without knowing the word for it, and has not said anything.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

**Physical Description:**
A big man going thick through the middle, with broad shoulders that haven't softened the way the rest of him has. Thick forearms, hands that have been worked rough and stayed that way. Short graying hair he keeps neat out of habit. A face that has practiced patience so long it has set that way — reads as calm in situations where calm is not what he feels. Wears the same kind of thing every day: work boots, jeans, a short-sleeve button shirt. Has worn it so long it has become a uniform.

**History:**
Born in Hardin County, grew up fifty miles from where he lives now. Served two years in the Army Reserve in his early twenties — nothing that took him anywhere notable, but enough to give him a framework he has never fully put down. Married Diane in 1974. Built Hutchins Electric from a truck and a license into a four-man operation over fifteen years. Has been quietly preparing since 1987 — not with ideology or politics, but with the bone-deep suspicion of a practical man who read the world and didn't like what it was telling him.

He has a property south of Ridgeway: a converted outbuilding on twelve acres with a well, propane supply, stored food, tools, and a gun cabinet that Diane used to call excessive. She stopped calling it that on July 6th.

**Current Status:**
Has told Morrow on the porch of the deer camp on the night of July 9th that he and Diane have known about the scratch since that afternoon. Is the second person in the group to hear Morrow's theory about transmission. Is now carrying that theory alongside everything else.

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

**Physical Description:**
Compact and capable-looking, with dark hair pulled back in a practical knot she hasn't taken down in three days. Sharp brown eyes that assess before they engage — a habit of the ER, reading a room and a situation in the same breath. Moves efficiently and without waste. Carries Lily on her back with the practiced ease of someone who has been carrying things for a long time.

**History:**
Grew up in Elizabethtown, the daughter of a school principal and a pharmacist. Studied nursing in Louisville, met Gary at a friend's wedding in 1973, married him the following year. Has worked the ER at Cortman Medical for eleven years. Was there on July 3rd when the hospital stopped being a hospital. Has not described what she saw that day to Gary in any detail. He has not pushed.

**Current Status:**
Has clocked Morrow's scratch, Hicks' fever, and Briggs' flatness. Has identified Vasquez as the person in the military group she can speak to directly. Will have a conversation with Vasquez before morning. Is the closest member of the group to understanding the true mechanism of reanimation — not there yet, but one more piece of information will be enough.

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16

**Physical Description:**
His father's height already, still on the lean side of it. Dark hair he wears a little long. A face that has been fairly transparent his whole life and is learning, unevenly, to close. Dark circles that weren't there a week ago.

**History:**
Born 1977. An average student with strong hands and his father's instinct for how things work. Was in Muldraugh on July 4th visiting a friend when the emergency rooms started turning violent. Walked the eight miles home alone, arriving after dark. Has not talked about what he saw on the way.

**Current Status:**
Watching Reyes. Watching Briggs. Learning things from both without knowing what to call what he's learning. Keeping Lily close. Has heard more of the conversations in the deer camp than the adults intended. Is sixteen years old and becoming someone.

---

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7

**Physical Description:**
Small for her age, with her mother's dark eyes and her father's tendency to set her jaw when she's determined. Hair in two braids Diane redid on the morning of July 9th out of habit. Carries a yellow Sony Walkman everywhere — a birthday gift from March, her most prized possession. The batteries died on July 7th. Gary replaced them on the night of July 9th with two AAs from his jacket pocket. She fell asleep to the warped second half of Lionel Richie's *Hello* on a tape that had been started and stopped too many times.

**Notes:**
She knows something is wrong. She is seven, not stupid. What she has been given to understand is incomplete and partial. She presses play the way some kids carry blankets — not because it does anything, but because the action is familiar, and familiar is what she has.
