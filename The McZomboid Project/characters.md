## 🪖 Morrow's Squad

---

### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 38
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Six foot even, built like someone who used to be bigger and has been burning it off from the inside. Dark hair going gray at the temples, cut close. A face that has spent too much time in the sun over too many years — lined around the eyes, rough at the jaw. He moves with the deliberate economy of a man who learned long ago that wasted motion costs something. His left sleeve is rolled down and buttoned at the wrist regardless of the heat.

**History:**
Born in Dothan, Alabama, the second of four kids. His father worked the line at a peanut processing plant; his mother kept the house and the peace. Dale enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available to him and he understood, even then, that he needed structure the way some people need water. He was good at it — good enough to make sergeant by twenty-six, good enough to keep it. He has been stationed at Fort Knox since 1990. He has a daughter in Georgia he calls every Sunday. He has not been able to call since July 1st.

**The Scratch:**
Received the morning of July 8th during a perimeter sweep near West Point. A civilian came out of a house without warning. Her fingernails caught the inside of his forearm as she fell — three short lines, nothing that needed stitches. He has watched four people turn this week. One had a bite. Three had nothing visible. He has been sitting with that arithmetic since the morning it happened.

**Where They Stand:**
Morrow has fully disclosed his situation — the scratch and his transmission theory — to both Gary Hutchins and Lieutenant Greer. He is operating under Greer's command and doing so without visible reservation, running his own parallel assessment underneath the official one. He is the connective tissue between the military structure and the Hutchins family, trusted by both in the specific way that comes from demonstrated honesty under pressure. He is not afraid of the scratch the way he was. He is afraid of the things that killed the people he watched turn, because those things are still out there and he doesn't know what they were.

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, stocky, with hands that always look dirty even when they aren't. Brown hair cut to regulation, a broad flat face that defaults to neutral. Sweats constantly and doesn't seem to notice. Has a habit of wiping his palms on his thighs before touching anything mechanical, like a ritual.

**History:**
Grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Took his first engine apart at fourteen — a lawn mower, then a neighbor's Buick, then anything that held still long enough. Enlisted because the Army would pay him to do the only thing he was genuinely good at. He is not ideological about service. He does the job.

**Where They Stand:**
Cutler found the F-150 in a clearing off a two-track east of the deer camp on the morning of July 10th. He found other things in that clearing that he did not describe to anyone and does not intend to. He is currently driving the group east on Route 9 with a missing third cylinder and a loose exhaust and the particular focused calm of a man who has decided that the truck is the only thing he is responsible for right now. That is a useful decision and it is also the kind of decision a person makes when the alternative is thinking about the clearing.

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Slight, sandy-haired, with the open unguarded face of someone who hasn't yet learned to close it. Freckled across the nose and cheeks. Always doing something small with his hands. Looks younger than twenty. Has aged about four years in the past week.

**History:**
From Elizabethtown, Kentucky — twenty minutes outside the exclusion zone. His mother and his younger brother are inside it. He hasn't told Morrow this because he doesn't know what Morrow would do with the information. Enlisted eight months ago. This is his first posting. He was supposed to go home for his mother's birthday on July 12th.

**Where They Stand:**
Shores is riding in the truck bed, handling it with the specific volume management of a young man who has understood that the road is not the place for talking. He told Vasquez what he knew about Morrow's scratch before the lore caught up to him. He doesn't know that the transmission theory he passed along has since been confirmed. He is two days past his mother's birthday with no way to know if she is alive and he is not discussing that with anyone, which means he is discussing everything else.

---

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, designated marksman

**Physical Description:**
Lean and dark, with close-cropped black hair and eyes that don't settle. Not tall, but occupies a considered amount of space. A scar along the left side of his jaw he has never explained. Almost always at the periphery of wherever the group is.

**History:**
Grew up in San Antonio, the son of a retired Army staff sergeant. Two prior deployments — Panama, '89, and a brief unremarked assignment in '91. He has seen things end badly before and has developed the habit of positioning himself so that when they do, he is already facing the right direction.

**Where They Stand:**
Reyes has said what he saw on the road from West Point. The man in the lawn mowing gloves. The forty seconds. He said it to Vasquez and Diane in the truck bed on the morning of July 10th because the road east was the right geography for it and because withholding operational information past its usefulness is its own kind of failure. He is watching the road behind them from the truck bed. He is watching Hicks. He is watching Jesse watching him, and he has not decided yet what to do about that.

---

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Tall and angular, with a long neck and eyes set a little too far apart. Still growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, tends to stand half a step behind whoever is nearest.

**History:**
From rural Indiana. Graduated high school in May, enlisted in June, arrived at Fort Knox forty-eight hours before the phones went dead. Has been in-country, so to speak, for his entire military career.

**Where They Stand:**
Webb was with Cutler in the clearing. He sat stiff and quiet in the passenger seat all the way back to the deer camp and has been stiff and quiet since. He is functional and following instructions. He is also somewhere else in the half-second intervals that Briggs has and that Jesse has started to recognize as a category of thing. It may pass. It may not.

---

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium build, dark circles, a pallor that has deepened since July 7th. Currently lying in the bed of the F-150 under a blue tarp folded into a pad, which is where he has been since the group left the deer camp.

**History:**
From Memphis. Three years of service. Has a girlfriend named Janet who believes he is working and is fine because that was true on June 30th and the phones have been dead since July 1st.

**Where They Stand:**
Hicks is dying. He has known this since at least the night of July 9th when Morrow sat with him in the dark and told him the honest version of what he knew. His fever is worsening. Diane is monitoring him. The zero-to-one-minute window that Reyes reported and Diane confirmed is now the operational fact organizing everyone's awareness of him — not spoken aloud in the cab, not flagged to Lily, not performed as drama, just present the way a serious thing is present when people who deal with serious things are managing it. Hicks is aware of this too. He has not asked anyone to make any decisions on his behalf. He has not asked anyone not to.

## 🪖 Greer's Unit

---

### First Lieutenant Paul Greer
**Age:** 27
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11A Infantry Officer

**Physical Description:**
Medium height and lean, with the upright bearing of someone who earned it through ROTC and has maintained it through conviction. Brown hair, regulation cut. Still clean-shaven. A face young enough to be readable — you can see him processing things if you watch closely enough. Carries himself like a man who believes the situation is manageable.

**History:**
Grew up in Cincinnati. Eagle Scout. ROTC at Ohio State, commissioned 1989, promoted to first lieutenant eighteen months ago. Stationed at Fort Knox since 1991. This is the first assignment of his career that has required him to make decisions not covered somewhere in his training.

**The Two Missing Soldiers:**
Greer's unit departed Fort Knox with six personnel. It arrived at the back road with four. He has not discussed this. If asked, he will give a factual account in a flat voice and move on. What that account contains is not yet part of the story.

**Where They Stand:**
Greer now holds all the significant information: Morrow's scratch, the transmission theory, the zero-to-one-minute reanimation window. He absorbed it, reorganized around it, and kept moving — which is either very good leadership or the thing that precedes it breaking, and is possibly both. At the civilian roadblock on Route 9 he stopped, listened, gave away four days of rations and a radio frequency, and told a woman with a shotgun he would send someone back if he got through. He meant it. Whether the county between here and Lincoln will allow him to make it true is a question the road is still answering. He is riding in the cab of the second vehicle — Cross driving, Morrow beside him — watching Knox County pass and keeping his own counsel.

### Sergeant First Class Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 34
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, senior NCO

**Physical Description:**
Compact and direct, dark hair pulled back tight, brown eyes that move constantly. A small scar on her right knuckles she doesn't explain. Moves without telegraphing. Does not fill silence.

**History:**
Grew up in El Paso. Fifteen years in the Army, long enough to understand the distance between what the institution says it does and what it does. Follows Greer because he is her commanding officer and because his orders made sense when they were issued.

**Where They Stand:**
Vasquez is in the truck bed, watching the road behind them. She was the first person Diane found in the dark on the night of July 9th and the conversation between them on the porch remains the most complete accounting of the situation that any two people in the group have shared. She brought Reyes' disclosure out on the road when the time was right and has since folded the zero-to-one-minute window into her operational picture without visible disturbance. She will tell Greer when they stop. She is the clearest thinker in the group and she is also the person most likely to be the last one anyone notices is carrying something she hasn't said yet.

---

### Specialist Darnell Cross
**Age:** 23
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Broad-shouldered, unhurried, with a stillness that reads as confidence. Close-cropped hair, wide face, defaults to neutral attention. Always checks his bootlaces before moving — left one first.

**History:**
From Atlanta, middle of five kids. Three years of service, no enemies, several quiet friends.

**Where They Stand:**
Cross is driving the second vehicle — a truck commandeered from the military convoy's earlier assets — with Greer and Morrow. He is steady. He has been steady through everything and shows no signs of stopping. In a group where most people are managing something in addition to the immediate task, Cross appears to be managing only the immediate task, which makes him invaluable in ways nobody has said out loud because saying it out loud seems like the kind of thing that would jinx it.

### Private First Class Owen Briggs
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, fair-skinned with blond hair. Would have a pleasant face in other circumstances. Currently carries a flatness of expression that comes from something that has not finished processing. His eyes go somewhere else briefly — a half-second at a time, like a signal dropping.

**History:**
From western Pennsylvania. Was in the same unit as the two soldiers no longer with Greer's column. Was present for whatever happened to them.

**Where They Stand:**
Briggs is riding in the truck bed, functional, following instructions. Webb has the same half-second vacancy now. Jesse has noticed both of them and recognized it as a category of thing without having a name for it. Whatever is stored in Briggs from the events that reduced Greer's unit from six to four is stored well enough to operate around. It will not stay stored indefinitely.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

**Physical Description:**
A big man gone thick through the middle, broad shoulders that haven't softened with the rest of him. Thick forearms, permanently rough hands. Short graying hair kept neat out of habit. A face that has practiced patience so long it has set that way — reads as calm in situations where calm is not what he feels. Work boots, jeans, short-sleeve button shirt, every day, like a uniform.

**History:**
Born in Hardin County, grew up fifty miles from where he lives now. Two years in the Army Reserve in his early twenties — nothing that took him anywhere notable, but enough to give him a framework he has never put down. Married Diane in 1974. Built Hutchins Electric from a truck and a license into a four-man operation over fifteen years. Has been quietly preparing since 1987 — not from ideology, but from the bone-deep suspicion of a practical man who read the world and didn't like what it was telling him. Has a property south of Ridgeway with a well, propane, stored food, and a gun cabinet Diane used to call excessive. She stopped calling it that on July 6th.

**Where They Stand:**
Gary is in the cab of the F-150, watching the road and the sides of the road and teaching Jesse to do the same. He carries more information than most people in the group — Morrow's theory, Diane's confirmation, the full picture of the transmission question — and is holding it the way he holds most things: without performing it, without putting it down. The woman at the crossroads on Route 9 is in his rearview mirror alongside the bicycle with the spinning wheel and the sprinkler and the church with its doors open and dark inside. He is adding them to a tab that he will settle with himself later. He has been doing that since July 6th and the tab is getting long.

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

**Physical Description:**
Compact and capable-looking, dark hair in a practical knot she hasn't taken down in four days. Sharp brown eyes that assess before they engage. Moves without waste. Has been carrying Lily on her back for most of two days.

**History:**
Grew up in Elizabethtown, daughter of a school principal and a pharmacist. Studied nursing in Louisville, met Gary in 1973, married him the following year. Eleven years in the ER at Cortman Medical. Was there on July 3rd when it stopped being a hospital. Has not described what she saw that day in any detail. Gary has not pushed.

**Where They Stand:**
Diane is in the truck bed with Hicks, monitoring him at intervals with the steady clinical attention of someone who knows what the monitoring is for and is not looking away from it. She is the closest person in the group to the truth about reanimation — not because she was told more than others but because she saw it earliest and has been building toward the complete picture longest. Vasquez is the person she has spoken to most honestly. The conversation they had on the porch of the deer camp in the small hours of July 10th was the most direct exchange of real information that has happened in this story so far. She is watching Hicks. She is watching the road. She is watching the group the way she watched her ER — for what the vitals don't show.

---

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16

**Physical Description:**
His father's height, still lean, dark hair worn a little long. A face that has been transparent his whole life and is learning, unevenly, to close. Dark circles that weren't there a week ago.

**History:**
Born 1977. Average student, strong hands, his father's instinct for how things work. Was in Muldraugh on July 4th when the emergency rooms turned violent. Walked the eight miles home alone, after dark. Has not talked about what he saw on the way.

**Where They Stand:**
Jesse is in the cab of the F-150 with Lily's head on his shoulder, watching Knox County through the passenger window. His father told him to look at the road and the sides of the road and the things that move, and he is trying to do that, and sometimes the other things make it through anyway — the spinning bicycle wheel, the church doors, the woman in the mirror getting smaller until she was gone. He said *Dad* when she disappeared around the curve and his father said *I know* and that was all of it and it was enough. He is sixteen years old and he is building a curriculum from the people around him. He has identified Webb's vacancy and Briggs' half-second dropout as a category of thing. He does not yet know what to call it or what it means for him.

---

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7

**Physical Description:**
Small for her age, her mother's dark eyes, her father's jaw when she sets it. Hair in two braids. Carries a yellow Sony Walkman — birthday gift from March, her most prized possession. Gary replaced the batteries on the night of July 9th with two AAs from his jacket pocket. She fell asleep to the warped second half of Lionel Richie's *Hello.* The tape has since run to the end. She presses play anyway and lets the blank hiss run.

**Where They Stand:**
Lily is in the cab with her head on Jesse's shoulder, asleep or close to it. She asked Jesse if the dog they passed on the road would be okay. He said it would be okay. She accepted the amendment in his voice without asking about it, which is either seven-year-old innocence or seven-year-old wisdom and may be both. She is the fixed point the group orients around without discussing it — the reason Greer stopped at the roadblock, the reason Gary measures his words in the cab, the reason the blue tarp in the truck bed is arranged the way it is. She does not know this. She is pressing play on a tape that has run out and listening to the hiss of it and that is enough for right now.
