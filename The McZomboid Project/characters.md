### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 38
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman — promoted through the ranks, never made officer, never wanted to

**Physical Description:**
Six foot even, built like someone who used to be bigger and has been burning it off from the inside. Dark hair going gray at the temples, cut close. A face that has spent too much time in the sun over too many years — lined around the eyes, rough at the jaw. He moves with the deliberate economy of a man who learned long ago that wasted motion costs something. His left sleeve is rolled down and buttoned at the wrist. It is July in Kentucky. He has not been asked about it.

**History:**
Born in Dothan, Alabama, the second of four kids. His father worked the line at a peanut processing plant; his mother kept the house and the peace. Dale enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available to him and he understood, even then, that he needed structure the way some people need water. He was good at it. Good enough to make sergeant by twenty-six, good enough to keep it. He has been stationed at Fort Knox since 1990, which means he knows this county — or knew it, before the 6th.

He has a daughter in Georgia he calls every Sunday. He has not been able to call since July 1st.

**The Scratch:**
Received the morning of July 8th during a perimeter sweep near West Point. A civilian came out of a house without warning. He put her down. Her fingernails caught the inside of his forearm as she fell — three short lines, nothing that needed stitches. He rolled his sleeve down and kept moving. He has watched enough in the past seventy-two hours to know what it means. He has not told his men.

**Notes:**
Morrow is not a cruel man. He is a man who has run the arithmetic and arrived at conclusions he has not shared. He will keep the group alive as long as he can. He is working on what *as long as he can* means.

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, stocky, with hands that always look dirty even when they aren't. Brown hair cut to regulation, a broad flat face that defaults to neutral. He sweats constantly and doesn't seem to notice. Has a habit of wiping his palms on his thighs before touching anything mechanical, like a ritual. Quiet in the way that comes from preferring to listen to engines rather than people.

**History:**
Grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Took his first engine apart at fourteen — a lawn mower, then a neighbor's Buick, then anything that held still long enough. Enlisted because the Army would pay him to do the only thing he was genuinely good at. He is not ideological about service. He does the job. The truck under the back road outside Muldraugh is the first job he has not been able to finish, and it has unsettled him more than anything he has seen in the past three days.

**Notes:**
Cutler's verdict on the truck is final and he knows it. He spent an extra hour under the chassis finding other things to check not because he thought there was a solution but because being under the truck was better than being above it.

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Slight, sandy-haired, with the open, unguarded face of someone who hasn't yet learned to close it. Freckled across the nose and cheeks. A little too much energy in his hands — he's always picking at something, turning something over, doing something small with his fingers when he's not supposed to be talking. He looks younger than twenty. He has aged about four years in the past week.

**History:**
From Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Twenty minutes outside the exclusion zone by highway. His mother and his younger brother are inside it. He hasn't told Morrow this because he doesn't know what Morrow would do with the information and he doesn't want to find out. He enlisted eight months ago. This is his first posting. He was supposed to go home for his mother's birthday on July 12th.

He fills silence because the silence, lately, has sounds in it.

**Notes:**
Shores is the most likely to extend trust to the Hutchins family — genuinely and without calculation. He is also the most likely to say something he shouldn't. Morrow watches him the way you watch a window in a storm.

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, designated marksman

**Physical Description:**
Lean and dark, with close-cropped black hair and eyes that don't settle. Not tall, but he takes up a considered amount of space — the posture of someone who has decided exactly how much of the world he will occupy and holds that line. A scar along the left side of his jaw from before the Army; he has never explained it and no one asks twice. He is almost always at the edge of wherever the group is.

**History:**
Grew up in San Antonio, the son of a retired Army staff sergeant. Joined because it was expected, stayed because it suited him. Two prior deployments — Panama, '89, and a brief, unremarked assignment in '91 that he does not discuss. He has seen things end badly before. He has learned to position himself so that when they do, he is already facing the right direction.

What he saw on the road down from West Point on July 8th confirmed something he had been suspecting since July 4th. He has not shared this because there is nothing useful in the sharing of it.

**Notes:**
Reyes is not reckless and not cruel. He is operating on a shorter timeline than everyone else in the group — not because of injury, but because he has already accepted where this is going. He will be useful until he decides he won't be, and when that moment comes it will be a considered decision.

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Tall and angular, with a long neck and eyes set a little too far apart. Still has the look of someone who hasn't finished growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, follows where he's pointed. Has a tendency to stand half a step behind whoever is nearest to him.

**History:**
From a small town in rural Indiana. Graduated high school in May, enlisted in June, arrived at Fort Knox with forty-eight hours to spare before the phones went dead. Has been in-country, so to speak, for his entire military career. Does what he's told because he has not yet learned to do otherwise.

**Notes:**
Webb is not a factor yet. He may become one.

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium build going soft, dark circles under his eyes, a pallor that his tan is losing the argument against. He has been sitting apart from the group most of the afternoon with his knees drawn up. Occasionally presses the back of his hand to his forehead in a way that looks like habit — checking for something he doesn't want to find.

**History:**
From Memphis. Third year of service, no particular distinction. Has a girlfriend he writes letters to that he has not mailed in two weeks. He has been running a low fever since July 7th. He has not told Morrow. The pattern of who is not telling Morrow things and why is one of the more structurally significant facts about this group.

**Notes:**
Hicks is sick. Whether it is the flu — the real kind, the ordinary summer kind that still existed one week ago — or something else is a question that will not stay a question much longer.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

**Physical Description:**
A big man going thick through the middle, with broad shoulders that haven't softened the way the rest of him has. Thick forearms, hands that have been worked rough and stayed that way. Short graying hair he keeps neat out of habit. A face that has practiced patience so long it has set that way — he reads as calm in situations where calm is not what he feels. Wears the same kind of thing every day: work boots, jeans, a short-sleeve button shirt. Has worn it so long it's become a uniform.

**History:**
Born in Hardin County, grew up fifty miles from where he lives now. Served two years in the Army Reserve in his early twenties — nothing that took him anywhere notable, but enough to give him a framework he has never fully put down. Married Diane in 1974. Built Hutchins Electric from a truck and a license into a four-man operation over fifteen years. Has been quietly preparing since 1987 — not with ideology, not with any particular political conviction, but with the bone-deep suspicion of a practical man who read the world and didn't like what it was telling him.

He has a property south of Ridgeway: a converted outbuilding on twelve acres with a well, a propane supply, stored food, tools, and a gun cabinet that Diane used to call excessive. She stopped calling it that on July 6th.

His brother-in-law's deer camp is three quarters of a mile east of where they are standing. He has spent enough weekends there to know every inch of it in the dark.

**Notes:**
Gary is not a hard man, though he can be. What he is, mostly, is tired of being right about things he wanted to be wrong about. He recognized what was in Morrow's sleeve before Diane said anything. He is keeping that to himself for the same reason Morrow is — because if he says it out loud, he has to decide what to do about it.

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

**Physical Description:**
Compact and capable-looking, with dark hair pulled back in a practical knot that she hasn't taken down in three days. Sharp brown eyes that assess before they engage — a habit of the ER, reading a room and a situation in the same breath. She moves efficiently, without waste, the way people do who spend their working lives in places where wasted motion has a cost. Carries Lily on her back with the practiced ease of someone who has been carrying things for a long time.

**History:**
Grew up in Elizabethtown, the daughter of a school principal and a pharmacist. Studied nursing in Louisville, met Gary at a friend's wedding in 1973, married him the following year over her mother's quiet reservations about the age difference. Has worked the ER at Cortman Medical for eleven years. She is good at it in the way that requires a certain willingness to see things clearly and keep moving — the willingness, specifically, not to flinch.

Cortman Medical stopped being a hospital on July 3rd. She was there when it happened. She has not described what she saw on July 3rd to Gary in any detail, and he has not pushed.

She is the reason the family has kept its head since the 6th. Not because Gary couldn't — he could — but because in a crisis Diane's operating mode is the steady burn of someone who has already processed the worst-case and is now working from it, whereas Gary's tends toward the controlled pressure of someone still working up to acceptance.

**Notes:**
Diane clocked Morrow's scratch within the first ten minutes. She clocked Hicks' coloring within five. She has been deciding, quietly and without drama, what the right thing to do is. The moment she calls Morrow by his first name is the moment she has decided. What she does next will define what this group becomes.

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16
**Occupation:** High school sophomore (rising junior)

**Physical Description:**
His father's height already, still on the lean side of it. Dark hair he wears a little long, which Gary has been meaning to make him cut since April. A face that has been fairly transparent his whole life — Diane always knew what he was feeling from across a room — but has been learning to close in the past seventy-two hours, unevenly, the way teenagers learn things. Has dark circles that weren't there a week ago.

**History:**
Born 1977, grew up in the same house his parents still own outside Muldraugh. An average student with strong hands and his father's instinct for how things work. Played baseball until last year when he quit without fully explaining why. Reads more than either of his parents knows. Was in Muldraugh on July 4th visiting a friend when the emergency rooms started turning violent; walked the eight miles home alone, arriving after dark. Has not talked about what he saw on the way.

He keeps Lily close. Has done so since the 6th without being asked. It is the most adult thing about him and it is also, sometimes, the only thing keeping him from coming apart.

**Notes:**
Jesse is learning things by watching Reyes in the same way that Shores is learning things by watching Jesse, and none of them know that's what's happening. He is sixteen years old and he is becoming someone. Whether that someone is a person his parents will recognize remains to be seen.

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7
**Occupation:** Second grade (upcoming)

**Physical Description:**
Small for her age, with her mother's dark eyes and her father's tendency to set her jaw when she's determined about something. Wears her hair in two braids that Diane redid this morning out of habit, the way you keep doing the ordinary things. Has a yellow Sony Walkman — her most prized possession, a birthday gift from March — that she carries everywhere. The batteries died on July 7th. She clicks the play button anyway.

**History:**
Born 1986. Spent her whole life in a house that smelled like her father's work and her mother's cooking and the ordinary accumulation of a family going about its life. Started second grade in September and loved it. Has a best friend named Caitlin who lives four streets over. Does not yet know that four streets over is a different world now.

She knows something is wrong. She is seven, not stupid. What she has been given to understand is incomplete and partial, the way adults give children understanding when they are trying to protect them, and the protection is its own kind of weight.

**The Walkman:**
Dead batteries, no music. She presses play every little while the way some kids carry blankets — not because it does anything but because the action is familiar and familiar is what she has.

**Notes:**
Lily is not a prop. She is a seven-year-old girl in the middle of something no one should have to be in the middle of, holding a yellow Walkman with dead batteries, asleep against her mother's shoulder at the end of the first chapter of a very long story.
