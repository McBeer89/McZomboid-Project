# Chapter Nine: The Wire

*Checkpoint Harlan, Lincoln County, Kentucky. July 11, 1993. Morning into afternoon.*

## I.

It started with shouting at the supply depot, which was on the north side of the armory block behind the inner fence, and Gary heard it before he saw it because he was at the water station in Sector A and the inner fence was sixty yards away and the morning was otherwise quiet.

He set down the jerry can.

The shouting resolved into something more specific — commands, the sharp directional bark of soldiers who had made a decision and were executing it, and underneath that a sound that Gary had learned this week to separate from all other sounds, the way you learned to separate a particular frequency from static. He had it categorized before he was consciously aware of categorizing it.

He moved to the inner fence line without running.

What he could see through the chain-link was partial and out of sequence, the way all crisis looked from the wrong angle — soldiers converging on the far corner of the supply depot, a vehicle moving at speed across the inner yard, two men in civilian clothes on the ground near the depot's side door with their hands visible, and between those men and the soldiers a confusion of movement that resolved, as Gary watched, into three distinct figures moving wrong.

Not fast. Not dramatic. Just wrong, in the specific, unmistakable way that Gary now recognized the way he recognized the smell.

The soldiers handled it in under two minutes. Gary watched them do it with the clinical attention of a man who was accounting for what he was seeing and filing it in the correct place. It was contained. Three figures, the depot's side yard, no spread into the main inner area. Efficient, awful, over.

Then the radio traffic started.

Gary could hear it from the fence — not the words, just the pattern of it, the specific rhythm of a command structure responding to a situation. Vehicles began moving inside the inner yard. Soldiers who had been visible at the barracks block disappeared toward the perimeter fence. The watchtower soldier swiveled to face outward rather than inward.

The weight of attention inside the wire shifted like weather.

Ruth appeared beside him. He hadn't heard her come up.

"Supply depot," he said.

"I can see that." She was watching the inner yard with the flat, assessing attention she brought to everything. "How many."

"Three. It's handled."

She made a note on the clipboard. Gary looked at her making the note and thought about what it said about her that her first instinct, watching what they had just watched, was to record it.

"They'll pull toward the perimeter," Gary said. "Interior presence will thin out."

"Yes." She looked at him. "Which means the civilian block is going to feel less managed for a while."

"Is that a problem."

Ruth looked at the tent rows. At the three hundred and some people going about the business of a second morning at Harlan, most of them not yet aware of what had just happened forty yards away.

"It depends on what people do with it," she said.

Gary watched a soldier jog past the inner fence toward the perimeter, rifle up, the focused movement of someone with a destination. Then another. Then a vehicle following.

"What do you need," he said.

Ruth handed him the clipboard.

## II.

Greer had scheduled the conversation for 0900. The fact of the scheduling — a time, a location, the deliberate arrangement of it — told Morrow something about how Greer was approaching it. Not avoidance. Preparation.

They met in a small room off the barracks corridor, the kind of room that existed in every military building Gary had ever been in — too small for a meeting, too large for storage, perpetually in use for the thing that needed to happen away from other things. A table, two chairs, a window that looked at the inner fence.

Greer closed the door.

"You're formally reporting the scratch," he said.

"Yes, sir."

"I've reviewed the situation with the CO." Greer sat, which was an invitation for Morrow to sit, which Morrow did. "The intelligence gathered at the perimeter over the last four days is consistent with what you observed and what Mrs. Hutchins confirmed. Transmission is not contact-dependent." He said it in the flat voice he used when he was stating something that had already been decided. "Command is aware. The scratch is not, in their current assessment, a reportable exposure."

Morrow held that. "They know."

"They've known since the ninth," Greer said. "Longer, probably, at levels above this installation. The official position hasn't caught up to the operational knowledge yet." A pause. "That gap is going to close. When it does, the calculus around what gets reported changes for everyone inside this wire."

Morrow looked at the window. At the inner fence beyond it. At the soldier moving along the perimeter in the opposite direction from all the others. "The CO."

"Is working with incomplete information and making reasonable decisions from it," Greer said. "Which is what we're all doing." He set his hands flat on the table. "Dale."

Morrow looked at him.

"Mitchell and Pawlowski," Greer said.

The names sat in the room.

Morrow had been waiting for this since the deer camp. Not impatiently — he had learned that Greer moved at the pace of a man who prepared before he committed, and the patience had been its own kind of answer. But the names had been in the room every time the two of them were in a room together since July 8th, and now Greer had said them, and the waiting was over.

"I'm going to tell you what I reported to the CO this morning," Greer said. "Accurately. Which means I'm going to tell you what I told him and also what I didn't."

"Yes, sir."

Greer looked at the table. The particular quality of a man who had held something for several days and was now setting it down carefully, in the right place, with the right amount of deliberateness.

"We lost contact with the main unit on the evening of the seventh," he said. "Mitchell went down first — fever, fast onset, the kind that moved in hours not days. I thought it was heat and dehydration. I was wrong." He paused. "He was dead by midnight. He was up again by 12:01."

Morrow was very still.

"Pawlowski was with him when it happened. He—" Greer stopped. Restarted. "Pawlowski did not survive the encounter." Another stop. "I handled Mitchell. Briggs handled the immediate situation with Pawlowski. Then I handled Pawlowski."

"Briggs was—"

"Present for both." Greer's jaw worked once. "He did what needed doing and he has not spoken of it since. I have not asked him to."

The room was quiet. Outside the window the inner yard had that particular morning quality of a place running harder than it was designed to — too much movement, too much radio, the machinery of an institution that was pushing against its own tolerances.

"The CO's report says we lost two personnel to hostile engagement during movement from Fort Knox," Greer said. "That is not inaccurate. It is not complete." He held Morrow's eyes. "I'm not going to tell you that was the right call. I'm going to tell you it was the call I made and I'm accountable for it."

Morrow thought about Tommy Hicks. About the form on the clipboard and the separate board and what Greer's face had done when the pen moved. About the way some men chose their accountabilities and carried them without making a performance of the carrying.

"Understood, sir," he said.

Greer held the look for another moment. Then he moved some papers on the table in the way of a man closing one thing and opening the next.

"The situation at the perimeter," he said. "Tell me what you saw this morning."

## III.

Lena had the radio on the cot beside her when Jesse arrived, a small shortwave unit the size of a hardcover book with a telescoping antenna that she had extended to its full length and angled toward the canopy opening. She was writing in the notebook with the radio playing low — voices, static, voices again — and she did not look up when Jesse sat down.

He had been coming back since yesterday. He had not told anyone he was coming back. He was not sure what to call it yet, this thing he was doing with Lena Park and her notebook and the questions she asked that were smaller than they sounded. He knew it was part of the curriculum. He knew it was not only that.

"Riots in DC last night," she said, without preamble. Still writing. "New York and Los Angeles too. The President was on the radio at five this morning denouncing them."

Jesse looked at the radio. "Where are you getting this."

"Shortwave. And AM when AM is carrying anything real, which is less and less." She turned a page. "WHO grounded all civilian flights worldwide as of six PM yesterday. The European Community is closing internal borders." She looked up at him. "The stock market dropped eleven percent on Friday. It's Sunday. Markets are closed. I don't know what Monday looks like."

Jesse absorbed this in the way he had been learning to absorb information this week — not reacting to each piece as it arrived, but holding it and letting the shape of it assemble.

"How long have you known this," he said.

"The WHO announcement I heard yesterday afternoon. The riots were overnight, I picked them up this morning." She set the pen down. "The CDC made an announcement on Friday that got retracted within the hour. A Dr. Galbraithe — he was dismissed from the CDC a few years ago, after something called the Raleigh outbreak — he said the agency's response was hampered by underfunding and internal politics." She paused. "The retraction said the original statement was released without authorization and that everyone at the CDC respects Dr. Galbraithe's many achievements." She held Jesse's eyes. "They attacked him and then praised him in the same hour. That tells you more than either statement."

Jesse thought about this. "Raleigh," he said.

Lena looked at him sharply. "You know about Raleigh."

"I know the name. From something one of the soldiers said on the road." He paused, being careful. "There was an incident there. A few years ago. Something that was covered up."

Lena wrote something in the notebook. "1990. A lab in Raleigh had a — an incident. The official story was a gas leak and mass hysteria. The lab belonged to a subsidiary of Knox Telecommunications." She let that land. "The same company that operates the facility near Rosewood. Inside the exclusion zone."

The radio cycled through static and found a voice — a broadcaster, measured and professional, reporting something about peacekeeping forces being deployed to American cities. Jesse listened to fifteen seconds of it and then it was static again.

"The people in this block," Jesse said. "Do they know any of this."

"Some of it. The ones with radios. There are four shortwave sets in the civilian area that I know of, including mine." She paused. "Most people know something is wrong outside the wire. Most people don't know how wrong." She looked at the canopy entrance, at the tent rows beyond it, at the ordinary business of Harlan's second morning continuing without obvious awareness of what the radio had been saying since midnight. "There's a question of when to tell people things," she said. "And how. And in what order."

"Ruth manages what people know," Jesse said.

"Ruth manages what people are ready for," Lena said. It was a distinction, not a correction. "Those aren't always the same thing."

Jesse looked at the notebook. At the pages of close, careful handwriting that represented what Lena Park had been assembling since July 3rd, when she'd been covering a story about a bad flu in a small Kentucky town and the story had swallowed itself whole.

"What else," he said.

Lena picked up the pen.

She talked for another forty minutes. Jesse listened in the way he had learned to listen — not to the surface of the words but to the architecture underneath them, to what the information meant in sequence, to what it implied about what came next. The European Community's border closures meant the problem was no longer being treated as American. The WHO grounding flights meant international containment was at least being attempted, which meant the problem was already international enough to warrant the attempt. The stock markets meant money was reading the situation faster than governments were saying it.

And the CDC's retraction — the one-hour reversal, the praise following the attack — meant someone inside the federal response knew something they weren't ready to say publicly, and the shape of that something could be read from the gap between what Galbraithe had said and how fast they'd walked it back.

Jesse did not have words for all of this yet. He had the shape of it.

"I need to tell my dad," he said.

Lena looked at him. "I know," she said. "That's why I'm telling you."

## IV.

Gary found Marcus at the vehicle staging area at the south end of the drill field, which was where the civilian transport had been parked since intake — a loose collection of cars, trucks, and one van that had arrived with survivors over the past four days, now sitting in the afternoon heat with the improvised organization of a parking lot that no one had been officially assigned to manage.

Marcus was standing between a mid-eighties Silverado and a Ford Ranger, not touching either of them. Looking. The particular focused look of a man conducting an assessment that had a specific purpose, which was different from the look of a man who was just looking.

He hadn't heard Gary come up. Gary stayed where he was.

After thirty seconds Marcus moved to the Silverado's driver side. He tried the handle — unlocked. He opened the door and stood in the opening without getting in, looking at the dash, at the ignition, at the column below it. He crouched slightly. His hands went to the column housing and he touched it in the way of a man checking tolerances — brief, professional, not exploratory. He had done this before.

He stood. Looked at the Ranger.

Then he looked at Gary.

Neither of them moved for a moment.

"Hutchins," Marcus said. He said it without surprise, which was its own kind of information.

"Marcus," Gary said.

A pause. The afternoon heat sat on the staging area. From the direction of the perimeter, something — a voice on a radio, distance-garbled — carried on the air and was gone.

"You were Reserve," Marcus said. Statement, not question.

"A long time ago."

"I wasn't anything," Marcus said. He said it in the flat, factual register of a man who had decided transparency was less expensive than the alternative. He looked at the Silverado. "That one will start. The Ranger needs a look at the battery. There are four others in here worth driving and three that aren't."

Gary looked at the vehicles. At Marcus. At the way Marcus held himself — not defensive, not performing calm, just present in the economical way of a man who had spent years in situations where the wrong movement cost something.

"Louisville," Gary said.

"Born there," Marcus said. "Mostly."

"What does mostly mean."

Marcus looked at the armory block. At the inner fence. At the flag, which Gary had been looking at since yesterday and which Marcus appeared to be looking at for the first time.

"It means I did some things in Louisville for some people and some of those things didn't strictly require being in Louisville." He paused. "And when the phones went dead on the first and the roads closed on the sixth I was in the right place to be in the wrong place, depending on how you look at it."

Gary looked at the Silverado's open door. At the column housing. At what Marcus had been doing when Gary had found him.

"You're taking inventory," Gary said.

"I'm taking inventory," Marcus agreed.

"For what."

Marcus looked at him steadily. He had the eyes of a man who assessed other men as a professional habit and had assessed Gary and arrived at a conclusion. "For when inventory is useful," he said. "Which I expect will be soon."

Gary held the look. The thing he had read in Marcus since the water station on the first morning — the category of *useful or problem* — had not resolved. He was beginning to think it was not going to resolve. He was beginning to think it was not supposed to.

"Don't touch the military vehicles on the other side of that fence," Gary said.

"I wasn't going to," Marcus said.

"I know," Gary said. "I'm saying it anyway."

Marcus almost smiled. "Fair," he said.

Gary looked at the Silverado. At the four others Marcus had said were worth driving. He did the arithmetic that he had been doing since Del Norris talked for thirty minutes at the water station, the arithmetic that kept coming out the same way regardless of which numbers he used.

"When the time comes," Gary said. "I want to know what you know about these vehicles."

"When the time comes," Marcus said, "you'll know."

Gary left him there, standing between the Silverado and the Ranger, doing his inventory in the afternoon heat with the same alert stillness he brought to everything, and the category of *useful or problem* stayed unresolved and open, which Gary was deciding to treat as acceptable for now.

## V.

Jesse found Gary at the Sector C water station at half past four, which was where Gary went when he needed to think because the water station gave him a clear sightline to the armory block and the inner fence and the perimeter beyond, and thinking required something to look at.

He knew from the way Jesse walked that something had weight to it.

"Lena," Jesse said.

"Tell me," Gary said.

Jesse told him. He did it the way Gary had taught him to report things — sequentially, without editorializing, giving the information in the order that showed its logic. The WHO. The European borders. The riots. The CDC retraction and what it implied. The Knox Telecommunications connection to Raleigh. The stock markets.

Gary listened without interrupting.

When Jesse finished, Gary was quiet for a long time. He looked at the armory block. At the flag. At the upper windows where the lights had been on since before dawn, which was now two days in a row.

Jesse waited. He had learned to wait.

"The CDC thing," Gary said. "The retraction."

"Yeah."

"That's the one that matters most right now." Gary set down the jerry can he'd been holding. "The rest of it is bad and it's going to get worse. But the CDC walking back an attack on a man they fired for knowing too much — that's someone inside the government admitting they've been lying about how long they've known." He looked at Jesse. "Which means everything they've said about the scope of this being limited to Knox County—"

"Was already wrong when they said it," Jesse said.

"Or they knew it was going to be wrong," Gary said. "Which is different."

Jesse thought about this. About the architect of the thing Lena Park was building in her notebook — the way each piece of information implied the next one, the way the sequence told a story that the individual events didn't.

"There's more she hasn't told me yet," Jesse said. "She's being careful about the order."

"She's right to be," Gary said. "Knowing everything at once doesn't help you. Knowing the right thing at the right time does." He picked up the jerry can. "She's good at this."

"Yeah," Jesse said.

"So are you," Gary said. He said it the way he said most things about Jesse — without ceremony, like a factual observation, which was its own kind of ceremony.

Jesse looked at the inner fence. At the perimeter beyond it, where the military presence had thickened since the morning's supply depot incident and the soldiers were watching outward rather than inward and the dark beyond the wire was doing what the dark always did, which was wait.

"Del Norris told you the perimeter isn't going to open," Jesse said.

"No," Gary said. "It isn't."

"And Lena says outside the wire the world is getting worse."

"Yes."

"So what we have," Jesse said, "is this." He gestured at Harlan — the tents, the armory block, the fence, the generator hum, all of it.

"For now," Gary said. "Yes."

Jesse looked at it. At all of it. He was sixteen years old and he was doing the same arithmetic his father was doing and arriving at the same answer, which was that the arithmetic kept coming out the same way regardless of the numbers, and the answer was that this was temporary in a way that nothing at Harlan had officially acknowledged yet.

"Okay," Jesse said.

Gary looked at him. At the face that had been transparent all his life and was becoming something else — not closed, just deeper, the transparency going further down before it resolved. The face of someone who was building something and knew it and was not finished.

"Okay," Gary said.

They stood at the water station in the afternoon heat and looked at Checkpoint Harlan together, and the generator held its note, and the flag moved in the small evening wind, and somewhere in the tent rows Lily was pressing play on a tape that had already run out.
