# Chapter Seven: What the Walls Are For

*Knox County / Lincoln County, Kentucky. July 10, 1993. Afternoon.*

## I.

They heard it before they saw it.

The generators came through the tree line as a low, mechanical note underneath everything — not loud, not dramatic, just present the way a heartbeat was present if you put your ear to the right place. Cutler heard it first and eased off the accelerator without being asked. Gary heard it a second later and felt something move in his chest that was not quite relief because he had learned this week not to let things be relief until he had more information.

"That's a lot of equipment," Cutler said.

"Yes it is."

The road curved north and the trees thinned and then Harlan was in front of them.

Gary had been forming a picture of it since Greer said the word on the night of July 9th, sitting at the folding table in the deer camp with the kerosene lamp between them. He had been building it from the words — *armory, stores, communications, walls worth something* — and from his own two years of Reserve service twenty years ago, and from the specific architectural vocabulary of military installations that lived in him the way all practical knowledge lived in him, quietly and available when needed.

The picture he had built was not wrong. It was just smaller than the reality.

The fence line ran the length of a city block in both directions from the main gate — chain-link topped with concertina wire that caught the afternoon sun in small bright points. Military vehicles were positioned at intervals along the inside perimeter, not parked, placed. The watchtower at the gate corner had a soldier in it with a long gun and a sightline that covered the road back to the curve they'd just come around. The armory building itself sat behind an inner fence — two-story brick, institutional, the flag still flying from the pole out front in the particular way of a place that was maintaining ceremony because ceremony was one of the things that kept order from becoming chaos.

Outside the inner fence, on what had been a drill field, was everything else.

Tents. More than Gary had expected. A lot more. The kind of field tenting that went up fast and got organized later — some of it organized now, some of it still in the fast-and-get-to-it stage. People moving between them. Generators at the far end of the field running what looked like a medical canopy. The sound of children somewhere that he couldn't locate. An argument near the tent line that was too far away to follow, the shape of it audible and the content not.

He had not let himself think about how many people had made it out of Knox County before the perimeter tightened on the 6th. Looking at the tent field now, he revised the estimate upward and kept the revision to himself.

"Dad," Jesse said.

"I see it."

In the side mirror, the second vehicle had stopped ten yards back. Greer was already out.

Cutler pulled forward to the gate.

## II.

The specialist on the gate was maybe twenty-two and had the face of a man who had been running on bad sleep and high stakes for four days and had arrived at a state somewhere on the other side of tired that had its own flat, careful quality. He came out of the guard position with his rifle at the low ready and his eyes moving across the truck in the practiced way of someone who had been doing this long enough this week to have developed practices.

He saw the civilian truck first.

Gary watched his face make the calculation — the quick inventory, the category assignment, the response protocol engaging. A civilian vehicle meant survivors, which meant processing, which meant paperwork and assignment and the specific friction of a system designed for soldiers trying to absorb people it wasn't designed for. The response protocol was not hostile. It was not warm. It was the face of a man executing a procedure.

Then Greer came around the hood of the second vehicle in his uniform and the calculation changed.

"Sir." A different kind of attention. Shoulders adjusting.

"Specialist." Greer came up to the gate with his ID ready. "Lieutenant Paul Greer, Fort Knox. I have four military personnel and a civilian family of four. We have a wounded — "he paused a half-second, " — we have a casualty to report."

The specialist looked at the ID. Looked at the second vehicle. Did the count.

"The civilians, sir. They're authorized?"

"They're under my escort and they're going through this gate," Greer said. He said it without heat, in the flat voice of a man accounting for something that was not a question. "Get me your CO on the radio."

The radio call took seven minutes.

Gary sat in the truck and watched the specialist work the handset with the methodical patience of a man who had made this call before and knew the shape of it. The gate was open enough to pass a person but not a vehicle. Cutler kept the engine at idle. Lily had her hand in the pocket where the Walkman was, not taking it out, just touching it.

Through the fence Gary could see the tent field with more clarity now — the organization of it, the way the tenting had been arranged by someone who thought about sightlines and foot traffic even in a crisis. He could see the medical canopy better from here. The people moving between tents had the particular body language of people who had found a rhythm and were keeping it because rhythm was what you found when panic was no longer useful.

He was aware of the truck bed behind him in the way he had been aware of it since Route 9.

"Dad," Jesse said.

"Yeah."

"Is it going to work."

Gary watched Greer standing at the gate with his hands loose at his sides and his weight balanced and his face doing the thing it did — working through the framework, finding the version of the truth that fit inside the frame. He thought about what he'd told Lily on the road. *Greer is the kind of man who makes sure someone on the other end of that radio understands.*

"Yeah," Gary said. "It's going to work."

It worked. The gate rolled open at minute eight.

## III.

Processing happened in a low-ceilinged room inside the armory's outer building — folding tables, a private with a clipboard, the institutional smell of floor wax and recycled air that Gary associated with every government building he had ever been in. It was the most normal-smelling room he had encountered in four days and the normalcy of it was briefly disorienting.

Names. Ages. Civilian status noted in a column on the form. Pre-outbreak occupation. Medical conditions. Gary gave the information in the flat, sequential way he gave information to anyone holding a clipboard, and the private wrote it down with the efficient disinterest of a man processing a long line.

Greer handled the truck bed.

He stepped to the side with the processing private when the question came up — quietly, briefly, two sentences that Gary didn't catch from across the room. The private made a note on a different form. A separate form. Gary watched the pen move across the paper and watched the private clip it to a different section of the board, and that was Hicks now. That was the administrative fact of Tommy Hicks — a form, a column, a clip.

Morrow was standing near the door. He watched it happen the way he watched most things — flat, cataloguing. Something moved through his face and was gone.

Then the processing private looked up and said it was time to direct them to their assigned areas, and that was when the split happened.

It was logistical. Impersonal. Military personnel would be directed to the armory's barracks block; civilian family would be assigned to the tent area on the drill field, Sector C. The private said it with the brisk efficiency of someone who had said it many times in the past four days and had long since stopped reading the faces of the people he was saying it to.

There was no goodbye scene. Gary understood instinctively that a goodbye scene would be wrong — too much weight, too much performance for what had been, on the road, a functional arrangement between people who needed each other. They had needed each other. They had been honest with each other. That was not nothing and it did not require ceremony.

Morrow looked at Gary. Gary extended his hand and Morrow shook it — brief, firm, the handshake of two men who had established each other's competence and did not need to ornament that fact.

Then Gary picked up his bag and Diane picked up Lily and they followed the private toward the door that led to the drill field.

At the threshold Gary turned once. Not for a last look — there was nothing to see that he hadn't already seen. Just the instinct to mark the moment before it became the past.

Vasquez was looking at Diane from across the processing room. Just that. Diane held the look for two seconds. Something passed between them that Gary could see the shape of without being able to read the contents, the way you could see the shape of a conversation through a window without hearing the words.

Then they were outside and the door was behind them and the drill field was in front of them, large and loud and full of strangers.

## IV.

Sector C was the third row of tenting from the south fence, fifteen canvas shelters of varying size arranged with enough order to suggest organization and enough improvisation to suggest that the organization had happened in a hurry. A hand-lettered sign on a stake at the row entrance read SECTOR C in black marker, the letters level and deliberate, the sign itself a small act of will against chaos.

The family was assigned a space in the seventh shelter — cots, a folded blanket each, a ration pack on each cot. The private checked them in, pointed at the latrines, told them food distribution was at 1800 and 0700, told them the medical station was the canopy at the far end of the field, and left.

Gary stood in the shelter opening and looked at Sector C.

A woman was standing at the end of the row with a clipboard of her own. Fifties, gray hair pulled back, wearing a blue chambray shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbow. She was talking to a young couple two shelters down with the direct, unhurried manner of someone who had given the same information enough times to have stripped it of everything but the essential. As Gary watched, she finished, marked something on the clipboard, and looked up.

She saw them.

She came down the row without being summoned.

"New arrivals," she said. Not a question. "How many."

"Four," Gary said. "Two adults, two kids."

She made a note. "Food distribution is at six. Latrines are the blue structures at the south fence. There's a water station at the end of each row — the jerry cans marked with a red stripe are drinking water, the others are for washing. Don't mix them up, somebody already mixed them up once." She glanced at Diane. "Medical?"

"I'm a nurse," Diane said.

The woman looked at her with the quick, reassessing attention of someone updating an internal ledger. "The station at the north end needs people who know what they're doing. They've been running on two medics and a vet tech since the 8th." She said it factually, without drama. "When you're settled."

Diane nodded.

The woman looked at Lily. At the shape of the pocket where the Walkman was. Something in her face moved — brief, specific, gone before Gary could read it. She made another note on the clipboard.

"I'm Ruth," she said. "I'm in Shelter One if you need anything."

She walked back up the row to the young couple, who had a new question.

Gary watched her go.

"She didn't ask our names," Jesse said.

"She'll get them when she needs them," Gary said.

He went inside to put down his bag.

## V.

The kids were settled by the time the light went orange — Jesse against the shelter wall with his knees up and his eyes open, Lily on the cot nearest the entrance with the Walkman in her lap, not pressing play, just holding it the way she held it now. The ration packs had been eaten without comment. Outside, Sector C was settling into its evening rhythm — voices, the clank of the water station, someone's radio playing something indistinct two rows over.

Gary and Diane sat outside the shelter entrance in two folding chairs that had been stacked against the shelter wall when they arrived and that Gary had unfolded without discussing it. Close enough to hear the kids. Far enough to talk.

The light was going. The generators held their note.

They sat for a while without talking, which was its own kind of conversation. Nineteen years of marriage had produced a vocabulary of silences and Gary knew this one — the silence of two people who had been managing something together and had finally stopped managing for five minutes and were now in the space between the managing and the next thing.

Diane spoke first.

"There was a woman at Cortman," she said. "On the third. She'd brought her husband in that morning with the fever and she'd been there all day waiting. He died about four o'clock." She stopped. Looked at the generators at the far end of the field. "She wasn't in the room when it happened. She was in the hallway. I was the one who—" She stopped again. "I never got to tell her to stay back. It was that fast."

Gary said nothing. He knew better than to say anything yet.

"I've been thinking about Tommy Hicks and his girlfriend in Memphis." She turned the name over in her mouth like she was checking the weight of it. "Janet. She thinks he's working. She thinks he's fine." She paused. "That woman at Cortman — by the time she understood, she was already—"

She stopped.

Gary put his hand over hers on the arm of the chair. Not a gesture of comfort exactly. Just contact. The same contact that had been there through twenty years of bad nights and good ones, the point of presence that meant he was in the room and paying attention and was not going anywhere.

"Diane," he said.

"I know," she said. "I know."

They sat with it. The orange light went to red. A child was crying somewhere in the tent rows — not their child, just the sound of it, the ordinary evening grief of a small person at the end of a long day. It faded.

"The woman who runs this block," Diane said. "Ruth."

"Yeah."

"She's done this before. Not this — something. Some version of this." She paused. "You can tell."

"Yeah," Gary said. "I noticed."

"I want to know what it was."

"You'll find out," Gary said. "She'll tell you when she thinks you need to know it."

Diane looked at him. The small curve at the corner of her mouth that wasn't quite a smile in any other context was in this one. "You've known her for forty minutes."

"I've known her type my whole life," Gary said.

The red light went to gray. Inside the shelter, Lily made a small sound in the way of someone going under into sleep. Jesse was still against the wall. Still awake. Still taking inventory.

Gary looked at the inner fence of the armory block. At the lights on in the upper windows of the building. At the flag on the pole, barely moving in the evening air, doing its work in the dark the way flags did.

"The tab," Diane said quietly.

"Getting long," Gary said.

She squeezed his hand once.

They went back inside.

## VI.

Jesse waited until the shelter was breathing before he went out.

His mother was asleep — or close enough that the difference didn't matter. His father was still, which for his father was the same thing as asleep. Lily had been under since the crying child faded and her breathing had the total, reliable quality of a seven-year-old who had burned through everything she had.

He came out of the shelter entrance into the gray evening air and stood in the row and looked at Harlan.

The generators were a constant now, the way the highway had been a constant back home — a thing you stopped hearing because it never stopped. The tent rows stretched in both directions. Some shelters still had light inside them, the canvas walls glowing yellow from lanterns and flashlights, the shapes of people moving against the light like the shadows in a projector show. The medical canopy at the north end was still lit and still occupied. Somewhere in the armory block a door opened and closed.

He walked to the south fence.

Not to the wire itself — he stopped six feet from it and stood with his hands in his pockets and looked at what was on the other side. A road. A tree line. The dark that began where the perimeter lights ended. There was no movement that he could see. That didn't mean anything. He had learned that from Reyes — the absence of visible movement was information but not reassurance, and the distinction mattered.

He stood there for a while.

In the shelter row behind him, someone came out of one of the tents and moved toward the water station. A man, alone, with the careful deliberate walk of a person navigating a new space in the dark. Jesse watched him without turning to face him directly, the peripheral attention he had been practicing. The man filled a canteen from the red-stripe jerry can, correctly. Paused for a moment with the canteen in his hand. Looked at the armory block with an expression Jesse couldn't read from this distance but could feel the shape of — something specific, something being thought about. Then he went back to his shelter.

Jesse marked him. Filed him in the category of things worth returning to.

From somewhere deeper in the tent rows came the sound of someone crying. Not a child this time. An adult, the particular sound of a person who had found a private enough moment and was using it. Brief. Controlled, even in its losing of control. Then gone.

Jesse stood at the south fence and heard it and identified it as a category of thing and did not look away from the dark. What Reyes had taught him without meaning to teach him. What his father had said about looking at the road and the sides of the road and things that moved. What the week had been building in him, course by course, from people who were trying to get somewhere and had taken him along.

He did not know what to call what he was building. He knew he was building it.

He went back inside.

The generator held its note in the dark. The flag moved in the small night wind. Knox County was out there past the wire, doing what Knox County had been doing since July 9th, patient and without hurry, waiting for the walls to show what they were for.
