# Chapter Three: The First Night

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 9–10, 1993. Night.*

## I.

Diane had done her best work at night.

Eleven years in the ER had built her around the rhythms of a hospital after midnight — the way the fluorescent hum took on a different quality, the way a ward at two in the morning told you things a ward at noon wouldn't. She had learned to read the nighttime breathing of a room the way some people read weather — the difference between the sleep of someone healing and the sleep of someone fighting something, between a body at rest and a body working.

She lay on her back on the floor of the deer camp with her eyes open and read the room.

Lily on the cot, the slow deep breath of a child genuinely asleep. That was good. That one she could stop worrying about for a few hours.

Gary beside her, one hand on her wrist the way he slept when things were bad — not clutching, just present, a point of contact. Out within minutes of lying down the way men who had spent their whole lives doing physical work went out, sudden and complete.

Jesse against the wall with his knees up. Not asleep. Breathing too deliberately. She had watched him learn to fake sleep when he was nine years old and he had not improved at it in seven years.

The soldiers arranged in the spaces remaining — Cutler and Webb near the door, Shores on his side with his face to the wall, Briggs in the corner opposite Jesse with his jacket across his face. Reyes and Cross still outside on rotation, which she registered by their absence the same way she'd registered a monitor reading in a quiet ward.

Morrow in the chair by the window. Not pretending.

And in the far corner, separated from the rest by a few feet of deliberate distance that everybody had understood without discussing — Hicks.

She had checked him again at half past ten, when the lamp was low enough that the transaction could be quiet. The fever was worse. Not critical — not yet — but the trajectory was wrong. She had seen that trajectory before, in the weeks when everything was still pretending to be a normal summer. She had seen it in the waiting room chairs of Cortman Medical on July 2nd, July 3rd, right up until the waiting room stopped being a waiting room. She knew what that trajectory looked like when it arrived at its destination.

She sat up slowly, careful not to wake Gary, and found Vasquez already awake across the room.

They looked at each other in the dark.

They sat on the porch steps with the door pulled almost shut behind them, close enough to hear the room and far enough to talk. The night was hot and still, the kind of dark that had texture to it — the tree line a deeper black against the sky, the occasional sound from somewhere in the middle distance that Diane had learned in three days to categorize and file before it could do anything to her heart rate.

"Tell me what you know," Vasquez said. No preamble. Diane had already decided she liked this woman.

"I worked the ER through the third," Diane said. "I saw the flu come in on the second. Saw it change on the third." She paused. The next part was the part she hadn't said aloud, not even to Gary. "I saw three patients die of the flu that day. Fever, organ failure, the way a bad flu can kill someone if they're vulnerable. Two of them were older. One was thirty-one." She stopped. "I watched all three of them come back."

Vasquez was quiet.

"They hadn't been bitten," Diane said. "None of them had been anywhere near anyone who turned. They caught the flu and they died of the flu and then they got up." She kept her voice even the way she'd kept her voice even at the nurses' station on July 3rd while everything came apart around her. It was an old skill. It was the skill she was most tired of having. "So whatever they're saying about bites spreading it — that's not the whole picture. Maybe not even the main picture."

"Morrow's arm," Vasquez said.

"He's afraid of it for the wrong reason."

Vasquez turned that over. "You're going to tell him."

"I'm going to tell him when it's useful to tell him. Right now he's functioning. Fear is keeping him sharp and the fear is not entirely misplaced — an infected scratch can kill him six other ways even if that's not how this spreads." She looked at the trees. "When the fear stops being useful I'll tell him."

Vasquez nodded slowly. The nod of a woman filing information and trusting the source.

"Hicks," she said.

"Yes."

"How long."

"The fever started — when?"

"He was off on the seventh," Vasquez said. "I noticed it and didn't say anything because I didn't know what I was looking at yet." A brief pause. Something being set down honestly. "I know what I'm looking at now."

"If the pattern I saw at Cortman holds, he has a day. Maybe two." Diane paused. "Maybe less. It moves faster in some people. I don't know why."

Vasquez was quiet for a long moment. Down the logging road, Cross was a shadow at the edge of visibility, motionless the way good sentries were motionless.

"He needs to be told," Vasquez said. "Greer."

"I know."

"He won't take it well."

"Does anyone?"

Vasquez made the sound again — the one that wasn't quite anything, the one Diane had already started to understand as her version of agreement.

"He'll do the right thing," Vasquez said. "He always does the right thing. The problem is he figures out what the right thing is by measuring it against his orders, and his orders—"

"Were written on the sixth."

"Were written on the sixth," Vasquez agreed.

They sat in the heat and the dark. Somewhere in the trees something moved and then was still. Neither of them reacted. That was another thing you learned fast in July 1993 — which sounds you stood up for and which you sat with, and the ratio was changing every day in one direction.

"In the morning," Diane said. "Before we move."

"Before we move," Vasquez agreed.

Diane put her hand on the porch railing and looked at it for a moment — the peeling paint, the soft wood under it, somebody's weekend project from a few years back that was never quite finished. The ordinary evidence of an ordinary life that had been going on here until it stopped. There were coffee cans on this porch and rusted nails and a glider that tilted when you sat on it and none of it was relevant anymore except as a reminder that relevance could change very fast.

She went back inside.

## II.

Morrow heard it first because he hadn't slept.

A sound in the corner — not dramatic, not the sound you'd write about if you were writing about it. Just the particular change in someone's breathing that meant the body was working harder than it had been an hour ago. A low sound that was almost nothing and was not nothing.

He crossed the room in the dark with the practiced silence of a man who had spent twenty years moving through spaces where noise was a liability. He crouched beside Hicks and put his hand to the man's forehead the way Diane had shown him by doing it earlier, and the heat that came back was wrong.

Hicks opened his eyes.

They looked at each other in the dark.

"Sergeant," Hicks said. Just that. His voice had the particular flatness of someone who had been awake with their own thoughts long enough to wear through panic to something on the other side of it.

"I know," Morrow said.

"I should've—"

"I know," Morrow said again. Not unkind. The way you said something when the accounting didn't matter anymore.

Hicks looked at the ceiling. "Is it—" He stopped. Started again. "Am I going to turn."

Morrow was quiet for a moment. He thought about what he knew and what he didn't know and the distance between them that was still too large to cross with any honesty.

"I don't know how it works yet," he said. "Nobody does." He paused. "I know it's not just bites."

Hicks absorbed that. "That's not better."

"No."

A long quiet. Somewhere outside, Cross walked his slow perimeter, his boots barely audible on the dry ground. Inside, the room breathed around them, eight people in the dark at the end of the first day of what the world had become.

"Memphis," Hicks said. Unprompted, the way people said things at night when they weren't sure how many nights were left.

"Yeah."

"I've got a girl there. Janet." He stopped. "She doesn't know—" He gestured vaguely at the room, the darkness, the week that had just happened. "She doesn't know any of this yet. The radio, outside the zone, they're saying it's a quarantine. That the Army's handling it."

Morrow said nothing.

"She thinks I'm working," Hicks said. "She thinks I'm fine."

The particular cruelty of the phone lines going dead on July 1st was that it had left people on both sides of the perimeter with whatever version of the truth they'd had at the moment of the cutoff. Janet in Memphis believed something about Tommy Hicks that was wrong in every direction. She would keep believing it until she didn't, and there was nothing anyone in this room could do about any of that.

"She sounds like a smart woman," Morrow said. Because he had to say something.

Hicks almost smiled. The attempt at it moved across his face and didn't quite land.

"You should sleep," Morrow said.

"Yeah."

He waited until Hicks' breathing leveled out — whether into sleep or something that was doing its impression of sleep — and then he straightened and went back to the chair by the window and sat down with the night spread out in front of him and waited for morning.

## III.

The light came in gray and low, the way July mornings came when the day was going to be brutal later — a cool false promise that burned off by eight. Morrow heard the birds before he saw the light and he let himself have that for a minute, the ordinary fact of birds doing what birds did, before the day started doing what days did now.

He woke Greer at first light. The lieutenant came awake the way military people came awake — fully, immediately, no warm-up between asleep and present. They went outside together without discussion.

The porch. The coffee can of old nails. The tilted glider.

"Hicks," Morrow said.

Greer looked at him.

"He's been running a fever since the seventh. He was hiding it." Morrow paused. "I was aware of it before we stopped here and I should have reported it to you directly, sir. That's on me."

Greer was quiet. The quality of his quiet was different from Vasquez's quiet, Morrow noted — less patient, more structural, the silence of a man arranging facts against a framework rather than simply receiving them.

"How bad," Greer said.

"The nurse says a day. Maybe two."

The word *nurse* — Diane, her assessment, the weight behind it — landed on Greer's face and he did not move it away.

"She's certain."

"She worked the ER through the outbreak. She's seen this before." He paused. "She's as certain as the situation allows."

Greer put his hands on the porch railing and looked at the logging road in the gray morning light. A muscle moved in his jaw. Working through it in the way he worked through things — methodical, honest, unwilling to skip steps.

"He can't march," Greer said.

"No, sir."

"We can't carry him and move at pace and protect this many people."

"No, sir."

"And if he turns while we're moving—" He stopped. The sentence was its own answer. He straightened. "What are the options."

Morrow had thought about this in the chair by the window for most of the night. He laid them out the way he'd arranged them, in order of what they cost.

"We wait here. Give him whatever time he has. See if it breaks the other way — some people came through it. Not many, but some." He let that land. "Or we move without him. Leave him with supplies, a weapon, the option to—" He stopped. The sentence required a completion that neither of them wanted to say in the gray morning light. "Or we find a vehicle. Something closer to rolling than the truck we lost. Cutler says there may be something on this road — he heard an engine two days ago east of where we stalled. We go find it and we take it and we move everyone."

Greer turned that over. His face was doing the thing it did — readable, processing, not yet blank.

"The vehicle," he said. "How long."

"Cutler would need to see it first. Could be nothing. Could be something he can get running."

"And in the meantime Hicks is here."

"In the meantime Hicks is here."

The gray morning sat on everything. Down the logging road, Cross was handing off the perimeter walk to Reyes, who had materialized from somewhere in the tree line looking like a man who had been awake for days and had simply stopped registering that fact. Behind them the deer camp was beginning to wake — sounds from inside, someone moving, the particular restlessness of a group at the end of a first night in a new place.

Greer turned from the railing.

"We stay through the morning," he said. "Cutler takes Webb and looks for the vehicle. If he finds something workable, we prep to move by early afternoon." He paused. "If he doesn't—" He looked at the door. At the room inside. At the weight of the decision he was going to have to make if the morning came back empty. "We deal with that when we know."

"Yes, sir."

Greer held the railing. Something moving in his face that was going to be the first crack in the clean surface of the institutional framework, small enough right now to miss if you weren't watching for it.

"He didn't tell me," Greer said. Not angry. Working. "Hicks. He was sick and he didn't tell me."

"No, sir."

"Because he thought I'd leave him."

Morrow said nothing. The answer was yes, and they both knew it, and saying it out loud would require Greer to address the question of whether Hicks had been wrong, and that was not a question that had a clean answer in the gray morning light of July 10th.

"I wouldn't have left him," Greer said.

"I know, sir."

"He should have known that."

"He should have," Morrow said. "He was scared. Scared people make that calculation wrong."

Greer looked at him. Something passing between them that was about Hicks and about something else entirely — the scratch under the sleeve, the information Morrow had been sitting on since yesterday morning, the pattern of what people hid from the people responsible for them and why.

Morrow held the look.

"Is there anything else I should know," Greer said.

The morning was gray and the birds were doing what birds did and inside the deer camp Tommy Hicks was breathing the heavy, effortful breath of a body that had taken on more than it could carry.

"Yes, sir," Morrow said.

He started from the beginning.
