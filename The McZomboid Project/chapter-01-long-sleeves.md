# Chapter One: Long Sleeves

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 9, 1993. Late afternoon.*

---

The truck had come to rest at a slant, its right front tire dropped into a drainage ditch the driver hadn't seen until it was too late. It sat there like a tired animal, hood up, steam long since gone, just a dull green shape in the shade of the tree line with soldiers arranged around it in postures that told Gary everything he needed to know about their situation.

He stopped walking. Put his arm out. Diane walked into it without breaking stride, read him without looking, and stopped too.

Jesse drew up behind them with Lily's hand in his. Lily clicked her Walkman.

"Army," Gary said.

"I can see that," Diane said.

The road was a single lane of cracked asphalt that ran between two walls of Kentucky oak and sweetgum, the light coming through at a low angle and turning everything amber. Hot. Still. The kind of afternoon that pressed down. Gary had driven this road a hundred times in his life and never once thought about cover or sight lines or what was in those trees, and now he thought about almost nothing else.

One of the soldiers had seen them. He was already calling back over his shoulder.

"Stay behind me," Gary said.

"Gary." Diane's voice was even. The voice she used when she needed him to hear her and not just the word. "Walk normal."

He walked normal.

---

The sergeant met them in the road. Late thirties, Gary guessed, with the particular blankness of face that meant he'd already used up whatever expression he'd started the week with. Long sleeves. Gary noticed the long sleeves.

"Folks." Not a question, not a greeting. An acknowledgment.

"Our car's about a half mile back," Gary said. "Front axle. We've been walking since about two o'clock."

The sergeant looked past him at Diane, at the kids. Something in his face moved and then didn't.

"Where are you headed."

"We have a property. Off Ridgeway, south of—"

"You're not going to make Ridgeway tonight."

Gary knew that. He said nothing.

Behind the sergeant, a younger soldier had appeared and was watching them with barely concealed desperation. Early twenties, soft-faced, the kind of kid who looked like he should be stocking shelves somewhere. He was looking at Jesse the way people looked at other people when they wanted to talk and hadn't in a while.

"Sergeant Morrow," the young one said. "We got room by the truck. In the shade."

Morrow didn't turn around. "Shores."

"They got a little kid, Sergeant."

A beat. Gary watched Morrow's jaw work. Something being decided.

"You're welcome to rest in the shade," Morrow said. "We're not going anywhere for a while."

---

The mechanic was still under the truck when they settled against the rear wheel well, Lily between Diane's knees, Jesse with his back to the metal like he could sleep but wouldn't. Gary sat where he could see the road in both directions. Old habit. He'd told himself for years it was an old habit and tonight he was glad for it.

"What's wrong with it?" he asked the pair of boots sticking out from under the chassis.

A pause. The sound of something being tried and failing.

"Transfer case," the boots said. "Maybe the driveshaft. Both, probably." Another pause. "Definitely both."

"You have parts?"

"Not those parts."

Gary looked at Morrow, who was standing at the front of the truck looking down the road. "How long you been here."

"Since about eleven," Shores answered for him. He'd sat down nearby with the natural, uninvited ease of someone used to being tolerated. "Hit the ditch coming around that curve. Sergeant said we'd wait for another unit to come through." He picked at the grass beside the road. "That was five hours ago."

"Kenny," Morrow said. Not loud.

"Sorry, Sergeant."

Lily held up her Walkman toward Diane. Diane looked at it, pressed the play button, let the silence answer. Lily took it back and held it in her lap.

---

The other one — Reyes, Gary had caught the name — hadn't moved from the tree line. He stood with his back partly to the group, rifle at the low ready, watching the oaks. Gary had been watching him watch the trees for twenty minutes.

"He always like that," Gary said quietly.

Shores glanced back. "He saw something. On the way down from West Point." He said it like he was reporting weather. Like that was what it had become. "He doesn't say what. But since then, yeah. Like that."

Diane was looking at Morrow. Gary knew her looking at Morrow. He'd been doing it himself.

"Your sergeant hurt his arm," she said. Low. Not to Shores.

"He said it was—"

"I know what he said." She wasn't unkind about it. She was an ER nurse from a hospital that had stopped being a hospital on July 3rd, and she had seen, in those last two days, enough to know that what people said and what was true had become different countries. "When did it happen."

Shores looked at his hands. "Yesterday morning."

---

The light was going.

Gary had the angle of it figured down to maybe forty minutes of useful visibility, and then another twenty of the gray in-between, and then the dark, which was a different problem entirely. He'd said none of this out loud. Diane knew. Jesse was beginning to understand — he could see the boy doing the math, glancing at the trees the way Reyes was glancing at the trees, and Gary felt a complicated thing in his chest that he didn't examine.

Morrow came and sat on the running board nearby. It was the first time he'd stopped moving.

"You were Reserve," he said. Not a question.

"How."

"Way you've been standing." Morrow rested his elbows on his knees. His left sleeve was rolled down tight. "Way you looked at my men before you looked at me."

Gary said nothing.

"What unit."

"That matters right now?"

Morrow almost smiled. The face moved in the right direction and then stopped. "No." He looked at the road. "You know what's out there."

"I know what I've seen."

"Then you know we can't stay here after dark."

Gary looked at him. "I know that. You know that. What does your CO know."

Morrow was quiet a long time.

"My CO," he said, "is in West Point. I had radio contact this morning." He paused. "This morning."

The boots were still under the truck. The sound of trying had stopped.

---

Lily had fallen asleep against Diane, the Walkman still loose in her hand. Jesse sat awake and rigid, watching Reyes, learning something from him or trying to.

Diane looked at Gary across the sleeping child. He held her eyes. Did the thing they'd been doing for nineteen years where a whole conversation happened without any of it being said.

She looked at Morrow's arm.

Gary looked at the trees.

The light kept going.

---

It was Cutler who finally came out from under the truck, wiping his hands on a rag that had stopped doing anything useful an hour ago. He stood up, looked at Morrow, and shook his head once.

The small movement landed on the group like a stone on water.

Shores stopped talking. Webb, who'd been quiet all afternoon, looked at the road. Hicks, who'd been sitting apart with his knees up, put his head down.

"Okay," Morrow said. Just that.

He stood. Straightened his sleeve by reflex. Looked at Gary.

"There's a deer camp," Gary said. "About three quarters of a mile east. Off the road. My brother-in-law's. It's solid."

"You know the way in the dark."

"I know these roads."

Morrow looked at the trees. At Reyes. At his men. At Lily asleep against Diane, one hand still wrapped around a yellow Walkman that hadn't played anything in two days.

"Alright," he said.

He said it the way men said things when they'd run out of better options and knew it and were going anyway.

---

Gary fell back as they started to move, letting the column sort itself out — Reyes and Shores ahead, the family in the middle, Cutler and Webb and Hicks behind, Morrow at the rear.

Diane came up beside him. Lily on her back now, asleep across her shoulders.

"Dale," she said quietly. The sergeant's name, like she'd decided something.

Gary looked at her.

"We'll deal with it at the camp," she said. "Not here."

He didn't ask her what she meant. He didn't ask if she'd talked to Morrow. He looked at the road ahead, at the last amber light in the canopy going orange and then red and then the gray that came before the dark.

"Yeah," he said.

Jesse was walking close. Close enough to hear, Gary realized. He looked at his son — really looked, the way you didn't always do — and saw a face that had been sixteen years old one week ago and was something else now.

The boy didn't look back.

They walked.

Somewhere in the trees off to the left, something moved.

Reyes had already stopped walking.
