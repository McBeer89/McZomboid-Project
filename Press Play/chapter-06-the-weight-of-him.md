# Chapter Six: The Weight of Him

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 10, 1993. Midday.*

## I.

The road stopped them at a place that had no name.

A curve on Route 9 where the tree line pressed close on both sides and a utility pole had come down across both lanes — not recently, from the look of it, leaning at a diagonal with the wire slack and pooled in the ditch on the left side and the pole itself resting on the roof of a sedan that had been coming the other way when it fell or had been parked there or had simply been in the wrong place when the world reorganized itself around the question of what counted as important anymore.

Cutler stopped the truck. In the mirror, Cross stopped the second vehicle ten yards back.

Nobody said anything for a moment. They looked at the pole and the wire and the sedan and the math of it.

"Wire's dead," Cutler said. "Has to be, lines been out since the sixth." He said it like a man confirming something he was already ninety percent certain of, which was the only kind of certainty available lately.

"Has to be," Gary said.

"Those are two different statements."

"Yes they are."

Cutler looked at him. Gary looked back. They had arrived, in the two days since the truck found them, at the particular shorthand of two practical men who had established each other's competence and no longer needed to perform around it.

"We can move the sedan," Cutler said. "If it rolls and we get some people on the pole we can clear enough to get through." He paused. "Twenty minutes. Maybe less."

Greer was already out of the second vehicle. He came up to Cutler's window, looked at the blockage, did the same calculation in slightly less time.

"Morrow, Reyes, Cross," he said. "With me. Mr. Hutchins — your call."

Gary was out before Greer finished the sentence.

Outside was the full weight of a Kentucky July at noon — the heat coming from above and rising from the asphalt simultaneously, the air thick enough that breathing felt like a considered activity. The sulfur smell was stronger than it had been that morning, or Gary had stopped not noticing it at some point during the drive and was noticing it again now. He couldn't tell which.

He took the left side of the pole with Morrow. Cross and Reyes took the right. Greer went to the sedan and put it in neutral and began pushing from the front, the car rolling slowly in the direction of the ditch with the grinding protest of flat tires that hadn't moved in days.

It was the kind of work Gary had done all his life — uncomplicated, physical, requiring nothing but effort and coordination — and he found, in the focusing of it, a brief interval of clarity. His hands on the rough wood of the utility pole, the weight of it shifting, the way Morrow adjusted his grip without being told because Morrow had also done this kind of work all his life, just in different contexts.

He was aware of the tree line the way he was always aware of the tree line now. The ditch on the left. The sedan scraping toward the shoulder, Greer pushing steadily. The truck behind them with Diane in the bed and Lily in the cab and the blue tarp and what was under the blue tarp.

He had told himself he would not think about what was under the blue tarp while his hands were occupied with the pole. That was the kind of decision you made to get through the next twenty minutes and it was a reasonable decision and it was not entirely working.

The pole shifted. Greer got the sedan to the shoulder. Two more minutes of repositioning and the right lane was clear enough for a truck to thread through if the truck had a willing driver, which it did.

"Good," Greer said.

It was the most efficient word available and it was the right one.

They were getting back into the vehicles when Vasquez put her head over the side of the truck bed.

She looked at Greer. Just that.

Greer went still for one second. Then he came around to the side of the truck.

## II.

Diane had his hand.

That was the first thing Gary saw when he came around — Diane on her knees in the truck bed with Hicks' hand in both of hers, not doing anything medical with it, just holding it. The medical part was over. Her face had the specific composure of someone who had composed it deliberately and was maintaining the composition by will.

Hicks' chest was still.

Morrow had already stopped walking. Reyes had stopped at the tailgate and was looking at the tree line, not at the truck bed. Shores had gone quiet in the way of someone swallowing something large.

Jesse was in the cab and Gary turned back to the window and Jesse was watching through the glass. Gary shook his head once, the minimal signal that covered a large distance, and Jesse turned forward and put his arm around Lily and that was that.

Greer stood at the tailgate. His face was doing the thing it did — working, processing, finding the framework and finding the framework insufficient and finding the framework anyway.

"How long," he said.

"Just now," Diane said. "While you were on the pole."

Greer looked at Morrow.

"I have it," Morrow said. Just that.

A long second. Greer understood what he was being told. The zero-to-one-minute window. The arithmetic. Morrow had thought through what needed to happen and was offering to be the one who did it, which was the most significant thing one person could offer another in July 1993 Knox County and both of them knew it.

Greer shook his head.

"No," he said.

"Sir—"

"He's my soldier." Greer said it without drama, in the flat voice of a man accounting for something. "He was my soldier."

Morrow held the look for a moment. Vasquez held hers. The offer had been made and refused and the refusal was its own information about the lieutenant.

"Everyone back in the vehicles," Greer said. "Give me a minute."

Gary put his hand on Morrow's arm and they walked back to the F-150 together and got in without talking.

---

The minute was a minute. Not longer.

Then Greer came around the side of the truck and got into the second vehicle and said something to Cross that Gary couldn't hear, and Cross started the engine.

Cutler looked at Gary.

Gary looked at the road ahead.

"Drive," he said.

The F-150 moved east. The second vehicle followed. The utility pole lay on the shoulder behind them in the full July sun and they did not look back at it and the road ran on.

Lily said nothing. Her hand found Gary's arm and rested there and he put his hand over hers without looking away from the windshield.

After a while Jesse said, "Is Greer okay."

Gary thought about that. Through the rear window he could see the second vehicle keeping pace, Cross steady at the wheel, Greer in the passenger seat looking forward.

"He will be," Gary said.

Jesse accepted that. He was learning to accept the answers that were available rather than the answers that were sufficient, which was one of the things the week had been teaching him, which was not a thing Gary had ever wanted to teach him.

The road ran under them. Knox County opened up slightly east of where they'd been — less tree cover, wider shoulders, the occasional field visible between the remaining structures. The density of the left things thinned a little. Not gone, not safe, just thinner, the way the end of something was sometimes gradual before it was complete.

## III.

It was Reyes who heard it first, which surprised no one.

He rapped twice on the rear window of the cab and Gary turned and Reyes was pointing east and slightly north, one finger, the gesture of a man indicating a specific thing rather than a general direction.

Cutler slowed.

From somewhere ahead — far enough to be a sound rather than a source, close enough to be unambiguous — came the particular acoustic signature of a military installation under operational load. Generators. Vehicle engines at idle. And under both of those, barely there but present, the high-frequency crackle of radio equipment in active use.

Gary knew that sound. He had last heard it twenty-two years ago and it had apparently been waiting in his memory intact, because it arrived in his chest like recognition rather than information.

"That's the perimeter," he said.

Cutler didn't answer. His foot came off the accelerator and they rolled in the heat with the engine pulling them forward at just above idle, everyone in the vehicle holding the same breath.

"How far," Jesse said.

"Few miles," Gary said. "Maybe less."

He turned to look through the rear window. Greer had his window down. He was looking east, the same direction, with the expression of a man who has been navigating by a fixed point for two days and can now see it.

Whatever it cost him to get to the sound of those generators, Gary thought, was visible in his face for one moment and then was not.

Greer looked at Gary through the glass. Gary looked back.

Greer nodded.

Gary turned forward.

"Take it slow," he said to Cutler. "We don't know what they see when they see a civilian truck coming down the road."

"What do they see," Jesse said.

"Us," Gary said. "They see us. Which could mean different things depending on who's on the other end of the radio." He paused. "So we go slow and we go visible and we give them time to figure out we're worth letting through."

Lily had the Walkman in her lap. She was not pressing play. She was just holding it, watching the road ahead from between him and Jesse, the fixed point at the center of everything the group was doing without discussing it.

"Will they let us through," she said.

Gary looked down at her. The question was asked in the careful, precise way she asked things when she had already considered the possibility that the answer was no and was asking anyway.

"Greer has orders that say we belong on the other side of that perimeter," Gary said. "And Greer is the kind of man who is going to make sure someone on the other end of that radio understands that."

She considered this. "Is that a yes."

"It's the best yes available," he said.

She took that. Turned back to the road. Put the Walkman carefully in the pocket of her jacket like something being put away safely, which was the most specific gesture of trust he had seen in several days and which he was going to think about later, in the place where he kept the other things.

Cutler drove east.

The sound of the generators grew in the hot afternoon air, steady and mechanical and the closest thing to a promise that July 10th in Knox County had to offer, and they drove toward it with Hicks no longer in the truck bed and Greer no longer in doubt and the perimeter close enough now to mean something.

The road ran forward.

They followed it.
