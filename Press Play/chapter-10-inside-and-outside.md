# Chapter Ten — "Inside and Outside"

*Checkpoint Harlan, Lincoln County, Kentucky. July 12, 1993.*

---

The generator on the east side had changed pitch overnight.

Gary noticed it the way he noticed everything now — not as information but as arithmetic. The steady diesel thrum that had been part of the background since arrival had developed a hitch, a half-second skip in the cycle that repeated every forty seconds or so. Nobody else in the ration line seemed to hear it. They were tired, mostly. The line was longer this morning and the portions at the front of it were smaller. Yesterday had been two items and a cup of water. Today was one item and a cup of water and the woman handing it out wouldn't meet anyone's eyes.

He took his ration — a can of Vienna sausages, the label half-peeled — and moved out of the line. The sun was already bad at seven-thirty. The air smelled the way it always smelled now, sulfur and copper and the particular staleness of a place where too many people were living in too little space with not enough moving air. He'd stopped noticing the smell days ago, which bothered him more than the smell itself.

Diane was already up and gone. Medical station, same as every morning. She left before the ration line opened because the walk gave her ten minutes alone, which was the only kind of privacy available inside the wire. He understood that. Jesse was somewhere — probably already with the Park woman, or on his way to her. Lily was still asleep on her cot, or pretending to be, which was its own kind of sentence about the week she'd had.

Gary walked the perimeter of Sector C the way he did every morning. Not the wire itself — civilians didn't get near the wire — but the interior fence line that separated the civilian block from the staging area and the armory. He counted things. It was what he did. The guard post at the east gate had two soldiers yesterday. Today it had one, and the one was sitting on an ammunition crate with his rifle across his knees and his head down. The supply truck that had been parked behind the armory since July 8th was gone. Not moved — gone, the tire tracks still pressed into the mud where it had been.

Ruth was at the water station, clipboard in hand, talking to a man Gary didn't know. She saw him, nodded once, and went back to what she was doing. Her clipboard was thinner than it had been three days ago. He'd noticed that too. She'd started with a sheaf of intake forms and supply lists thick enough to bend the board. Now it was maybe fifteen pages. He didn't know if that meant she'd filed them somewhere or if there was less to track.

The generator skipped again. Forty seconds. Same hitch.

He ate the Vienna sausages standing up, one at a time, not because he was savoring them but because eating slowly was a discipline he'd imposed on himself since day two. You eat fast, your body thinks there's more coming. He drank the water in three swallows and crushed the cup and put it in the trash drum that was already overflowing. Nobody had emptied it.

A jeep came through the interior road between the armory and the command block. Gary stepped back to let it pass and saw Greer in the passenger seat. Their eyes met for maybe a second — recognition, not greeting. Greer was talking to the driver, one hand on the dash, already looking at something ahead. The jeep turned left toward the south gate. Gary watched it go.

That was all. A second. The ghost of the road in a look that had no room to land. Greer was inside the machine now, and the machine was moving fast enough that everything outside it was peripheral. Gary didn't blame him. He understood institutions. He'd spent two years in the Army Reserve and twenty years running a business and both had taught him the same thing: once you're inside the structure, the structure decides what you see.

He walked back to Sector C. The generator skipped.

Diane had the medical station to herself for the first twenty minutes, which was the part she needed.

The station was a repurposed storage tent with folding tables and plastic bins and a smell of antiseptic that couldn't quite cover the smell of everything else. She'd organized the supply shelf on her second day — bandages on the left, sorted by size; medications in the middle, alphabetical by generic name; instruments on the right, what few there were. The organization was for function. It was also for the thirty seconds it gave her every morning when she could stand at that shelf and be a nurse and nothing else.

She stood there now. Counted the gauze pads. Counted the bottles. Noted what was lower than yesterday and what was gone entirely. The amoxicillin was down to eleven capsules. Frank Briars needed at least seven more days on the course to clear the infection in his arm, and she was rationing three a day instead of four because three was what they had. The math didn't work. She'd known that since Tuesday but she did the math again anyway because doing it was the discipline and the discipline was the wall between this and Cortman.

She closed her eyes. Opened them. Went to work.

The first patient was a child with a blister that had gone septic — dirty water, bare feet, the obvious combination. She cleaned it, dressed it, told the mother to keep him off the ground, and knew the mother couldn't. The second was an older man with chest pain that was probably anxiety and might not be. She checked his pulse, asked the questions she'd been trained to ask, and told him to come back if it got worse, knowing that if it got worse there was nothing here that could help him.

She was rebandaging Frank Briars' arm when Vasquez came in.

Diane heard the footsteps first — deliberate, economical, the particular cadence of someone who moved through space without announcing it. She looked up. Vasquez was carrying a small ziplock bag, unlabeled, and she set it on the table next to Diane's elbow without ceremony.

"Cephalexin," Vasquez said. "Fourteen capsules. Should cover the course."

Diane opened the bag. Looked at the capsules. Looked at Vasquez. "Where did you get these?"

"Medical supply in the armory block. They had a surplus on the antibiotics from the last resupply. I checked your intake sheet."

The intake sheet was pinned to the supply shelf. It listed every patient, every condition, every medication dispensed. Anyone who walked in could read it. Vasquez had walked in, read it, identified what was needed, sourced it, and brought it across the line between the military side and the civilian side without being asked and without making it a production.

Diane understood what that cost. Not the antibiotics — the decision. An NCO walking materiel from the armory block to the civilian medical station was a line. Small, but a line.

"Thank you," Diane said. She said it the way she said it — level, specific, received.

Vasquez sat down on the folding chair by the tent flap. She didn't sit like someone visiting. She sat like someone who'd been standing for a long time and had found a place where the standing could stop for five minutes.

"Elena," Diane said. "You look tired."

"Yeah." Vasquez rubbed the back of her neck with one hand. "Not sleeping great."

Diane finished Frank's bandage, checked the edges, told him he was good for today. Frank nodded at Vasquez on his way out — the nod of a man who understood that the woman sitting in the chair had just brought the thing that was keeping his arm attached. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to.

When he was gone, Vasquez said: "What are you hearing over here?"

"About what?"

"About what happens next. The civilians. What they think is coming."

Diane set down the roll of gauze. "Most of them think we're waiting for something. Rescue, resupply, orders from somewhere. Ruth doesn't think that but she's managing people who do."

"That's about right." Vasquez paused. She had the look of someone choosing words, not from caution but from precision. "There's talk on our side. Not official — nobody's putting anything in writing. But the NCOs are hearing things from the officers, and the officers are hearing things from command, and what's coming down the chain isn't *protection*."

"What word are they using?"

"Consolidation." Vasquez let it sit. "Which could mean a lot of things. Could mean pulling the perimeter tighter. Could mean moving assets to a more defensible position. Could mean deciding which parts of this facility are essential and which parts aren't."

Diane looked at her. "And the civilian block isn't essential."

"The civilian block is a resource drain on a facility that is losing resources faster than it's replacing them. That's not my assessment. That's the arithmetic anyone with eyes can do."

"So what does consolidation look like?"

"I don't know yet. Nobody's said it out loud in a briefing I've been in. But the word is there, and the people using it aren't using it the way I'd use it." Vasquez met her eyes. "I'm not on board with what I think it means. I wanted you to know that."

Diane held the look. Two women. First-name basis. The weight in the room was the weight of a decision that Vasquez had made before she walked through the tent flap — the decision to say this to this person, in this place, because the institution she'd served for fifteen years was beginning to discuss something she couldn't stand behind.

"I'll tell Gary," Diane said.

"I know you will."

"Is there a timeline?"

"If the perimeter holds, maybe three or four more days before they have to make a call. If the perimeter doesn't hold—" Vasquez shrugged. One shoulder. "Faster."

She stood up. She didn't look like someone who'd just crossed a line. She looked like someone who'd been standing on the line for a while and had finally decided which side of it she was on.

"Any time," Diane said. The same words. The same weight.

Vasquez nodded and left.

Lena was sitting on the concrete slab behind the water treatment shed, which was where she always sat when she wanted to talk without being in anyone's sightline. She had the notebook open on her knee and the pencil behind her ear and the portable shortwave tucked into the cargo pocket of her jacket even though reception inside the wire was garbage. Jesse had learned her habits the way he learned everything now — by watching, by cataloguing, by building the map of how a person worked so he could understand what they were building.

She was building a record. He understood that. Everything she collected — the shortwave intercepts, the conversations with civilians, the scraps of official information that leaked through the chain — she was assembling into something that would outlast the situation. She was a reporter. This was what reporters did. But it was more than that. She believed that someone, somewhere, would eventually need to know what had happened here and how, and she was making sure the account existed.

He sat down next to her. She didn't look up from the notebook.

"I want to ask you something," she said. "And you can say no."

"Okay."

"July 4th. You were in Muldraugh when it started. You walked home." She looked at him now. "Eight miles. I want to know what you saw."

He'd known this was coming. Not the specific moment, but the shape of it — that eventually someone would ask, and that the someone would be her, and that when she asked he would have to decide whether the thing he'd been carrying for seven days was something he could put down or something that would only get heavier if he tried.

"Yeah," he said. "Okay."

He didn't know where to start. That was the first problem. The day had a before and an after and the line between them wasn't clean — it was a smear, a gradient, the way the light changes when clouds move in and you can't point to the exact second it got dark.

"I was at the arcade," he said. "Muldraugh. There's one on the main strip, past the Fossil station. I was there because Tommy Harris said he'd be there and Tommy had *Street Fighter II* money, so. That's why I was in Muldraugh."

Lena wrote. She didn't prompt him.

"The arcade closed early. The guy who runs it — I don't know his name, heavy guy, mustache — he said he was feeling sick and he was closing up. It was maybe four o'clock. Tommy had already left. I didn't have a ride because my mom was working and my dad was — I don't know where my dad was. So I was going to walk to the Cortman ER and wait for my mom's shift to end at seven."

He stopped. The next part was where the smear started.

"The ER was wrong when I got there. I knew it was wrong before I went in. There were too many cars in the lot and some of them were parked on the grass, like people had just stopped wherever. The doors were propped open. You could hear — it was loud. Not screaming exactly. More like a lot of people talking at once and none of them at the right volume."

He was quiet for a moment. Lena waited.

"I went in because my mom was in there. The waiting room was full. Standing room. People on the floor. A woman near the door was holding a towel against her neck and the towel was soaked through and she was just — sitting there, holding it, looking at the wall. The smell was. I don't know. Bad. Like the sulfur smell but also blood. Like a metal shop."

"Did you find your mom?"

"No. I got maybe fifteen feet inside and a man came out of the triage hallway at a run. Not running away from something. Running at — the wall, I think. He ran into the wall, hard, face-first, and then he stood back up and there was—" Jesse stopped. He closed his eyes. Opened them. "His face was wrong. Not from the wall. It was already wrong. His eyes were. I don't know how to say it. They were open but there was nothing operating them."

He looked at his hands. They were steady, which surprised him.

"That's when people started screaming. The real kind. And then more of them came out of the hallway — three, maybe four — and they weren't running, they were. Walking. But walking the wrong way. The way you walk when you're not deciding to walk, your body is just going forward because forward is where the sound is."

"Were they—"

"I didn't stay to find out what they were. A big guy near the door grabbed me by the shoulder and shoved me outside and said *go*, just that word, and I went. I was outside. The parking lot. It was — it was still daytime. That's the thing I keep. It was broad daylight and the sky was blue and the fireworks stands were still set up across the street and it was July 4th."

Lena wrote.

"I tried to find my mom's car. She drives a blue Buick Century. I couldn't find it. I found out later she'd already left — someone crashed into the ambulance bay and they evacuated staff through the back — but I didn't know that then. I just knew she wasn't there and the building behind me was making sounds I couldn't — I couldn't categorize. I didn't have a word for what was happening in there."

He took a breath. The telling was doing something he hadn't expected. It was flattening the memory, pressing it from three dimensions into two. The thing that had been inside his chest for seven days was becoming words on a page in someone else's handwriting. He didn't know yet if that made it lighter or just differently shaped.

"So I walked. It's eight miles from Cortman to our house. I've done it before — my dad made me walk it once when I was twelve because I missed curfew and he said if I was old enough to stay out late I was old enough to find my own way home. So I knew the route. Highway 31W north, then cut east on the back roads past the lumber yard."

"What time did you leave the hospital?"

"Maybe five. Five-fifteen. Still light. The road was — there were cars, but they were stopped. Not parked. Stopped in the road with the doors open and nobody in them. Some of them had the engines still running. I could hear them ticking. I walked on the shoulder and then I walked in the grass because the shoulder felt too. Open."

The fracture was here. He could feel it — the place where the linear memory broke apart and became pieces, images without sequence, the brain's filing system overwhelmed and dumping everything into a single unsorted drawer.

"There was a woman in a ditch. I don't know where exactly — somewhere past the Fossil station, before the Route 31 split. She was on her back in the ditch and I thought she was dead and then she moved and I thought she was hurt and then I saw—"

He stopped again. Longer this time.

"Her arm was at the wrong angle. Not broken-wrong. Detached-wrong. It was still connected but just barely, like something had pulled it and the skin was the only thing holding on. And she was trying to get up. She was on her back and she was trying to roll over and her legs were working but the arm was — dragging. And she didn't seem to know. She didn't seem to know about the arm."

Lena's pencil had stopped.

"I ran. I didn't — I should have. I don't know what I should have done. She wasn't — I don't think she was alive the way we mean alive. She had the same eyes as the man in the hallway. Nothing operating them. But she was moving and the sounds she was making were—" He shook his head. "I ran."

"That's the right response, Jesse."

"I know. I know that now. I didn't know it then. I just ran because my body ran."

The sun was directly overhead. The water treatment shed hummed behind them. Somewhere in the compound a hammer was striking metal, steady and even, someone repairing something.

"It got dark while I was walking. Somewhere around the lumber yard. I could still hear the fireworks — not from Muldraugh, from somewhere else, maybe Brandenburg — and sirens. Lots of sirens. The sky was. You know the sky. The purple in it."

"The Perseid-B trails."

"I didn't know that then. I just knew the sky was wrong. Purple streaks. And the fireworks were red and white and the purple was behind them and it looked like—" He searched for it. "It looked like the sky was sick too."

"What happened on the back roads?"

"It was dark. Full dark by the time I was past the lumber yard. I had the road by feel — I'd walked it enough to know the curves. There were sounds in the trees. Not animal sounds. I grew up out here. I know what deer sound like moving through brush, what raccoons sound like, what dogs sound like. This was. Different. Heavier. And slower. Like something walking that had forgotten the mechanics of how walking works."

He was quiet for ten seconds. Fifteen.

"One of them came out of the trees. I don't know where — past the Hendersons' mailbox, I think, because I remember the mailbox. It came out of the treeline on my left and it was just — there. In the road. Between me and home. It was a man. I think it was a man. He was wearing a t-shirt and jeans and one shoe. The other foot was bare and the toes were dragging wrong, like the foot was broken. He was maybe twenty feet away."

"What did you do?"

"Nothing, for a second. Maybe two seconds. I couldn't — my brain wouldn't. It was like trying to read a word in a language you don't know. You can see the letters but they don't make a thing. He was standing in the road and the purple light was behind him and he wasn't moving, and then he was. Toward me. Not fast. That shuffling walk. The broken-foot walk. And the sound he made was—"

Jesse pressed his palms flat against the concrete.

"It wasn't a groan. People say that but it wasn't. It was air moving through a throat that wasn't trying to make a sound. Like wind through a pipe. Just — pressure, escaping."

"You got past him."

"He got close. Closer than twenty feet. Closer than ten. I was backed up against — I don't know, a fence post or a tree, something behind me. And then he reached and I — his hand got my shirt. Here." Jesse touched his left shoulder. "He grabbed the fabric. The grip was — strong isn't the right word. It was like a machine. Not squeezing, just closed. I twisted. The shirt tore a little. I got loose and I went into the woods."

"Did he follow?"

"He tried. I could hear him. But the woods — I've been in those woods since I was eight. I know where the creek bed drops. I know where the fallen oak is. I know which side of the hill the rocks are on. He didn't know any of that. I heard him hit something, a tree or a rock, and then I just — I ran. Through the woods. Branches in my face. I couldn't see except when the purple light came through the canopy and then I could see too much."

"Too much?"

"The light made everything look like it was already dead. The trees, the ground, my own hands. Everything purple and cold-looking. I ran through it for — I don't know. It felt like an hour. It was probably fifteen minutes. The woods let out behind the Carvers' old property, which is a quarter mile from our house. I came out of the treeline and I could see our porch light."

He stopped talking. The silence had a different quality now — emptied, not full.

"My dad was on the porch with the shotgun. He didn't know I was coming. He'd been trying to call Cortman to reach my mom and the phones were dead and he was just — standing there. With the gun. Waiting for whatever was going to come out of the dark."

Lena wrote the last of it. Her handwriting was small and even and she filled the page without margins.

"He saw me come out of the trees and he didn't say anything for about ten seconds and then he said my name and I walked up the steps and he grabbed me — he just. He's not a hugger. My dad. He grabbed me and held on and I could feel the shotgun against my back because he was still holding it and he didn't let go for a long time."

Jesse looked at the notebook. At the words in someone else's hand that were his words now, outside of him, pressed flat into ink on paper.

"That's what I saw," he said.

Lena closed the notebook. She held the pencil in both hands, rolling it between her palms.

"Thank you," she said. Not lightly. The weight of a journalist who understood what a primary source account cost the source.

Jesse nodded. He didn't feel lighter. He didn't feel heavier. He felt like something that had been vibrating at a frequency only he could hear had been tuned down — not silenced, but lowered to a range where the rest of the world could share the load.

She wrote it down. That was the thing. She wrote it down.

---

Evening rations were the same as morning rations — one item, one cup of water — and Del Norris brought his to the Hutchins' patch of Sector C without being asked because that was how the friendship worked now. You shared a space. You didn't perform it.

Gary was sitting on an overturned crate with Diane beside him. Jesse was on the ground with his back against the tent pole. Lily was on her cot, Walkman headphones around her neck, not pressing play. Del settled onto the second crate, the one with the split in the seat that nobody else wanted, and opened his ration without looking at it.

"Fruit cocktail," he said. "Lovely."

"We got tuna," Gary said. "Want to trade?"

"I would rather eat my own boot."

They ate. The compound was quieter in the evenings — the generator noise and the distant sound of vehicles and the low murmur of a hundred and thirty people trying to live in a space designed for sixty. The sky to the west was orange going red, the sunset filtered through the haze that never fully cleared.

"Del," Diane said. "What was it like on the outside?"

She asked it the way she asked everything — directly, without softening it. Del looked at her, then at Gary, then at the kids. Jesse met his eyes. Lily was watching him from the cot with the particular stillness of a child who knows the adults are about to say real things.

"The kids hearing this?" Del asked.

"The kids are in it," Gary said. "They should know what *it* is."

Del chewed the last of his fruit cocktail. Wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Set the can down carefully on the ground beside his boot.

"I was outside the zone for six hours," he said. "July 5th into the 6th. I drove down from Louisville to check on my mother — she lives in Vine Grove, twenty minutes inside where they drew the line. I didn't know there was a line yet. I got to the blockade at Route 31 and they turned me around."

"What did the blockade look like?" Gary asked.

"Two Humvees across the road. Concertina wire. Six soldiers, maybe eight. One of them was shaking. Not from the cold — it was ninety degrees. He was standing at the checkpoint with his rifle up and his hands were going and he looked like he'd been awake for three days. The one who talked to me was calmer but his voice had that sound — you know the sound. When someone has said the same words so many times they've stopped being words."

"They told you to turn around."

"They told me the area was under quarantine due to a biological hazard and civilian access was restricted. I asked about my mother. He said they couldn't help with individual cases. I asked when it would open. He said he didn't have that information."

Del paused. Picked up the empty can. Put it down again.

"So I didn't leave. I parked on the shoulder a quarter mile back and I watched. Six hours. I saw three families try to come out. The soldiers stopped them at the wire. One man — big guy, farmer type, work boots — tried to go through. They fired a warning shot. He stopped. His wife was screaming. They had a kid in the car."

"They fired on civilians," Diane said. Not a question.

"Warning shot. Over his head. But the next time — maybe an hour later — a soldier tried to go the other direction. Young kid, younger than Jesse. He was inside the zone and he walked up to the checkpoint from the wrong side and he said he was going home. They didn't fire a warning shot. They fired at him."

The silence after that was the kind that has weight.

"Did they hit him?" Jesse asked.

"I don't know. He went down. I couldn't tell from where I was whether he was hit or whether he dropped because they fired. Two soldiers went out and brought him back inside. I didn't see him get up."

Gary was doing the arithmetic. Del could see it — the same look he always had when the numbers were coming in, the patient assessment of a man who didn't waste energy on shock because shock was a luxury.

"What about Louisville?" Gary asked.

"Louisville is where I need to tell you something I haven't told you yet." Del leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "I drove back to Louisville that night. The 6th. When I couldn't get through. By the time I got back to the city — maybe midnight — the hospitals were already full. Not Knox full. Not what you're describing from Cortman. But full. Flu cases. The same flu. High fevers, sweating, anxiety, people fainting in the waiting rooms."

Diane's face changed. Not dramatically — a shift around the eyes, the particular recognition of a medical professional hearing a clinical pattern described by a layperson and understanding exactly what it means.

"The same symptoms," she said.

"The same everything. The smell was there too — faint, not like in here, but there. Sulfur. And the water — my neighbor said the water tasted like pennies. Same thing people were saying in here weeks ago." Del rubbed his face with both hands. "I drove past the refugee camp they set up on the fairgrounds. Military tents, Red Cross vehicles, people from the zone who'd been displaced when they drew the perimeter. They were packed in. Hundreds of them. Coughing. And the soldiers guarding the camp — some of them were coughing too."

"It's not contained," Gary said. He didn't say it as revelation. He said it as confirmation.

"It was never contained. The perimeter isn't keeping it in. It's keeping *us* in. Whatever this is — the water, the air, the dust, whatever the hell is making people sick — it's already in Louisville. It was in Louisville before they drew the line. The line isn't medicine. The line is politics."

Gary looked at Diane. She looked back. The exchange lasted two seconds and contained a conversation that would have taken twenty minutes if they'd had the luxury of speaking it. They didn't.

"The camps," Diane said. "The refugee camps. Are they still there?"

"I don't know. That was six days ago. Based on what the Park girl has been hearing on the shortwave — the border closures, the riots, the curfews — I'd guess the camps are either overrun or abandoned by now. Louisville isn't a destination anymore. Louisville is the next Knox County, just bigger and slower."

Jesse heard all of it. Layered it onto what Lena had already given him — the WHO grounding flights, the European borders closing, the stock markets, the CDC retraction. The picture was complete now, or as complete as it was going to get from inside the wire. The zone was not a quarantine. It was a preview. Everything inside the wire was coming to the world outside it, and the world outside it was not ready and was not going to be ready and no amount of concertina wire and shaking soldiers was going to change the mathematics.

He looked at his father. Gary was looking at the sky — the orange fading to purple, the haze, the first faint suggestion of stars behind whatever was in the atmosphere that made the light wrong. His father's face had the look it got when the answer was bad but clear. The look that meant: okay. We know. Now we work with what we know.

Lily was watching from the cot.

She didn't say anything. She had been listening the way she always listened — with her whole body, curled on her side, the Walkman in her lap. The adults were talking about things that were too big for words she knew, but the feeling of it was clear. The feeling was: the place they were in was not going to stay. The place they were in was going to stop being a place, the way all the other places had stopped.

She watched her dad look at the sky. She watched her mom touch her dad's hand, once, quick, and then pull it back. She watched Jesse sitting very still against the tent pole with the look on his face that he got when he was thinking about something that hurt but that he wasn't going to say out loud. She watched the man — Del, the one with the big hands and the tired voice — stare at his empty can like it owed him something.

Everybody knew. That was the feeling. Everybody knew the same thing and nobody was saying it because saying it would make it real and real was too much for the orange light and the quiet evening and the sound of the generator skipping every forty seconds.

Lily picked up the Walkman. She put the headphones on. She pressed play.

The tape had been out for days. There was nothing on it — just the hiss of the empty reel turning, the faint mechanical whisper of the player doing its job with nothing to play. She pressed it to her ears and closed her eyes and listened to the sound of nothing running and running and running.

Outside, the generator skipped again.

The sky went purple.
