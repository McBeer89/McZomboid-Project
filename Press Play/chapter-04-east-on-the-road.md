# Chapter Four: East on the Road

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 10, 1993. Morning.*

## I.

Greer didn't speak for a long time.

That was the thing Morrow remembered afterward — not what he said, but the quality of the silence before it. The gray morning sitting on the porch, the birds, the distant sound of Cross finishing his walk, and Greer at the railing with his hands flat against the wood and his eyes on the logging road and something happening in him that was slow and structural, like a building deciding how to stand differently.

Morrow had told it straight. The scratch. What he'd watched in the days before the truck went into the ditch. The four people he'd seen turn, one of them bitten and three of them not. The theory he'd been carrying since July 8th like a stone in his boot — not knowing what to do with it, not willing to set it down until he had someone worth giving it to.

Greer took it all in without interruption.

When Morrow finished, the silence ran another half minute.

"You watched four people turn," Greer said. Flat. Cataloguing.

"Yes, sir."

"One bite, three without."

"One that I saw bites on. Three with nothing visible."

"And Mrs. Hutchins—"

"Saw the same pattern at Cortman Medical. Multiple patients. Flu deaths. No contact history." He paused. "She's certain of what she saw, sir. She's that kind of woman."

Another silence. Greer's jaw worked once and was still. "And you've been sitting on this since yesterday morning."

"I had a theory. Not a fact."

"The distinction being."

"One I can act on and one I can't."

Greer turned from the railing. He looked at Morrow's left arm — at the sleeve, buttoned down — with the direct, clinical attention of a man who had decided to look at a thing directly instead of around it.

"How does it feel," he said.

"Sore. Swollen a little. No fever." He paused. "Diane — Mrs. Hutchins — looked at it last night. She says the wound itself is the risk right now. Infection. Not—" He gestured with his other hand at the general shape of everything outside the perimeter. "Not that."

"She's confident."

"She's careful," Morrow said. "Which is different. She won't tell me I'm fine. She'll tell me what she knows and what she doesn't."

Greer looked at the arm another moment and then looked away, back at the road, back at the gray morning light that was starting to take on its first edge of heat. The decision visible in his posture — not the decision itself, but the shape of the man making it.

"You should have told me," he said. Not angry. Something more considered than anger.

"Yes, sir."

"I can't make the right call with the wrong information."

"No, sir."

"That applies to everyone here. Hicks, you, anyone else who's sitting on something they think they're protecting me from." He said it to the road rather than to Morrow, which was the version of the speech that was for both of them and for nobody in particular. "I understand why people do it. I'm not interested in the why. I need the what."

"Understood."

Greer was quiet another moment. Then something in his shoulders settled — not relaxed, resettled, a man redistributing a load to carry it farther.

"The theory about transmission," he said. "If it's right—"

"Then the zone is everyone who was breathing Knox County air in June," Morrow said. "Which is everyone inside the perimeter and possibly some people outside it."

The full shape of that sat between them.

"We don't know that," Greer said.

"No, sir."

"We have a data set of a handful of cases and a working hypothesis."

"Yes, sir."

"That's not enough to—" He stopped himself. Restarted. "We hold that information carefully. We use it to make better decisions about what we do next. We don't—" He looked for the word. "We don't let it become the only thing people are thinking about, because if it does, people stop functioning."

Morrow studied him. The lieutenant was doing what Morrow had watched him do in the brief the night before — finding the version of the truth that fit inside a frame that could still hold the group together. Not lying. Not denying. Choosing what to build on.

It was, Morrow thought, either very good leadership or the thing that came just before very good leadership broke.

"Cutler," Greer said. "Get him moving."

"Yes, sir."

## II.

Cutler had been a mechanic long enough to know that an engine you heard two days ago in a county that was coming apart was either long gone or waiting for you with a story attached, and the stories attached to waiting vehicles in Knox County right now were not the kind with good endings.

He knew this and went anyway because there was nothing else to do and because Greer had given him Webb and a direction and in the absence of better options a direction was something.

They moved east on the logging road in the early morning, the heat already building in the canopy overhead, the air still carrying the smell that had been in everything since June — the sulfur and copper that Cutler had stopped consciously noticing until he thought about it, at which point he noticed it constantly. Webb walked behind him and slightly to the right the way he always positioned himself, half a step behind whoever was nearest, like a moon that had found its orbit.

"You been on a lot of roads like this," Webb said, after a while.

"What roads."

"Like. Empty."

Cutler considered the question. "No."

Webb seemed to find this honest rather than discouraging, and they walked in silence through the sweetgum and hickory with the heat pressing down.

He heard the vehicle before he saw it. Not running — still, the engine cold — but audible in the way metal in the sunlight was audible, the particular tick of a truck that had been sitting in a clearing since the temperature last changed. Cutler knew that sound the way he knew all the sounds of things mechanical and not moving that wanted to be moving.

The clearing was maybe fifty yards off the road, down a rutted two-track that had been carved by decades of deer hunting and occasional ATVs. The truck was a 1988 Ford F-150, blue, half in the shade and half in the morning light, driver's door standing open in the way of a door opened fast and left that way.

Cutler held up a hand. They stopped.

He looked at the truck for a long moment. At the door. At the grass around it, pressed down in patterns that took him a few seconds to read correctly, and then he read them and was still for a moment longer.

He looked at Webb. "Stay here."

"Cutler—"

"Stay here and watch the tree line." He said it in the voice he'd learned from Reyes, which was the voice you used when you meant it without performing meaning it.

Webb stayed.

Cutler crossed the clearing slowly, watching where he put his feet, keeping to the edge of what had happened here and not the middle of it. The truck was intact — all four tires, glass unbroken, the bed empty except for a blue tarp folded against the side wall. He came around the driver's door and looked inside.

Keys in the ignition. Half a tank showing on the gauge. A child's sneaker on the passenger seat, small enough to be a six or seven year old's, white with a velcro strap. One sneaker. He noted it the way he noted all things mechanical and environmental, as information that was part of the picture.

He looked at the grass again. At what was pressed down and what was darker than it should be and what ended at the tree line thirty feet away without going any farther.

Whatever had happened in this clearing had ended at the tree line.

He climbed in. Put his hand on the dashboard, which was warm from the morning sun. Put it on the steering wheel and held it there for a moment, the way he always did before he started something, the ritual of contact. Then he turned the key.

The engine caught on the second try.

He let it run a minute, listening to it with the focused attention of a man who understood engines at a frequency other people couldn't access. A miss on the third cylinder that would need looking at, something loose in the exhaust that would be loud without being serious, the idle a little rough from sitting but evening out as it warmed. A working truck. An ugly-running, imperfect, profoundly necessary working truck.

He put it in reverse, backed it toward the two-track, and drove it to where Webb was standing at the edge of the road.

Webb looked at the open driver's door, now closed. At the truck. At Cutler's face.

"What's back there," Webb said.

"Nothing we can do anything about," Cutler said. "Get in."

## III.

Hicks was worse.

Diane had known when she woke, before she checked him, from the quality of his breathing across the room — the labor in it, the particular sound of lungs working harder than they should in the morning cool. She had checked him anyway because checking was what you did when you were a nurse, because the ritual of the check was what separated assessment from dread, and she had confirmed what she already knew.

Gary was awake. He looked at her face when she stood and read what he needed to from it, and they did the wordless thing, and then he stood and went outside and gave her the room.

She sat beside Hicks on the floor.

He was conscious, which was something. His eyes tracked her when she came close, the focus effortful but present.

"Still here," he said. His voice had roughened overnight.

"Still here," she agreed. "How's the pain."

"Chest. Some." He moved his hand vaguely. "Like breathing with a wet blanket on me."

She knew that description. She had heard it from several people in the last days of Cortman Medical, in the hours before they stopped describing things. She did not say this.

"I'm going to make you drink something," she said. "I need you to keep it down."

He managed half a canteen, slow, with rest in between. She watched him do it with the careful clinical attention she had built over eleven years of watching people do difficult things, and she kept the rest of her face and the rest of her thoughts separate from the watching.

Jesse appeared at her shoulder. She hadn't heard him cross the room.

"Can I—" He gestured at the canteen.

"Yes." She stood and let him take her place and watched her sixteen-year-old son hold the canteen steady for a sick soldier he had known for twelve hours, and the complicated thing that moved through her she also kept separate, filed it somewhere that could be opened later when there was time.

She went to the door.

Greer was on the porch with Gary and Morrow, the three of them in the particular configuration of people discussing something in low voices that resolved into silence when she came out. She let the silence resolve.

"Cutler's been gone an hour," she said.

"He'll come back with something or he won't," Greer said. He said it as a fact rather than a comfort and she respected him for that.

"If he comes back with something that runs," she said, "Tommy Hicks goes in the truck bed and we move this afternoon and we don't stop moving until we're out of this county."

"And if he doesn't."

She looked at Greer. At the lieutenant who was working as hard as any person she'd watched try to keep something together — patient, structured, not yet brittle. A good man in a situation that was going to keep asking him to be better than good.

"Then we have a different conversation," she said. "But I'd like to not have it."

Greer held her eyes. Something passing in his face that she filed alongside all the other things she'd filed this week — the data of people under pressure, the register of a human being at the edge of their training trying to find the next inch of solid ground.

"So would I," he said.

The logging road was empty and the morning was heating up fast and somewhere east of them Ray Cutler was either on his way back or he wasn't.

Then they heard the engine.

It came through the trees before it came around the bend — the rough idle of something that had been sitting and was now moving, the tick of an exhaust that wasn't quite right but wasn't going to stop anything. Gary cocked his head. Morrow straightened. Greer took one step off the porch.

The F-150 came around the bend with Cutler behind the wheel and Webb sitting stiff and quiet in the passenger seat, and it was the most useful thing anyone had seen since July 1st.

Cutler pulled up and killed the engine and climbed out. He looked at Greer.

"Third cylinder's missing," he said. "Exhaust is loose. I can fix the exhaust in twenty minutes if you've got any wire. The cylinder I can work around." He paused. "Half a tank. Enough to get us where we're going if where we're going is forty miles."

Greer looked at the truck for a moment. At the open bed, the blue tarp. At the keys still swinging in the ignition.

"Where'd you find it," Gary said.

"Clearing off a two-track," Cutler said. "About a mile east." He said it without looking at Webb and without adding anything to it, in the voice of a man who had decided that the shape of the information was all the situation required.

Gary looked at him. At the things Cutler wasn't saying. He looked at Webb, who was looking at the truck bed like a man who was somewhere else briefly.

"Right," Gary said. Just that.

Greer turned to Morrow. "Get everyone up and eating whatever we have. We move in two hours." He looked at Diane. "Hicks in the bed. The child too if she'll tolerate it. Keep the pace manageable."

"Yes," Diane said.

He looked at all of them — the civilian couple, his sergeant, the mechanic — with the clear-eyed attention of a man who had made his calculations and arrived at his commitment and was not interested in revisiting it.

"We're going to Harlan," he said. "We're going to get there. And we're going to figure out the rest when we can see it."

It was, Morrow thought, not the whole truth. But it was enough truth to move on, and moving was what they needed, and so he let it stand.

"Two hours," he said.

He went inside to wake the room.
