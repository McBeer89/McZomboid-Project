# Chapter Eleven — *"The Sound the World Makes"*

**July 14, 1993 — Harlan Emergency Shelter, Knox Exclusion Zone**

---

Two days had changed the compound the way water changes a basement — not all at once, but in a way that made everything you thought was solid feel soft underneath.

Gary stood at the edge of Sector C and looked at what Harlan had become while he wasn't watching. The ration station had closed yesterday. Not announced — just closed, the folding table still there with nothing on it and nobody behind it. The water station was still running but the pressure was low and the taste was worse, which was saying something. Ruth had stopped carrying the clipboard. He'd noticed that this morning. She was standing by the water drum with her arms crossed, talking to a woman Gary didn't know, and her hands were empty. Ruth without the clipboard was a sentence he didn't want to finish.

The guard posts on the east and south sides of the civilian block were unmanned. They'd been unmanned since yesterday afternoon. The soldiers hadn't been replaced — they'd been pulled inward, toward the armory and the command block, and nobody had come to explain why. The internal fence between Sector C and the staging area now had a chain and a padlock on the gate that hadn't been there two days ago. Someone had decided the civilians didn't need access to the vehicles anymore.

The generator had stopped skipping. It had stopped entirely. The east side was running on nothing now — no lights, no refrigeration for the medical supplies. Diane had moved the antibiotics and the insulin into a cooler with the last of the ice and the ice was mostly water.

The sky was the color of a bruise. It had been that color for three days.

---

Lena found them at what used to be breakfast — Gary and Diane on the crates, Jesse on the ground, Lily on the cot. She was carrying the notebook and the shortwave and the look on her face that Jesse had learned to read as *the news is bad and getting worse*.

She sat down cross-legged next to Jesse and opened the notebook.

"Overnight," she said. She didn't preamble anymore. The family had earned directness. "Thirty-eight nations issued a joint UN statement yesterday — 'complete lack of clarity' from the US. Vatican City closed. Swiss Guard evacuated all visitors. Curfews in Chicago, San Diego, Baltimore. And General McGrew went on the air and said—" She checked her notes. "No need for further panic. The sufferers are 'not deceased.' And the search for a cure is ongoing."

"Not deceased," Gary said.

"His words."

"That's a hell of a way to describe people who died and got back up."

Lena closed the notebook. "There's more. I picked up a fragment this morning — military frequency, not encrypted well enough. There's a situation at the exclusion zone perimeter. Not here. The main boundary line, south and west. Civilian unrest. It sounded like a protest, maybe, or a confrontation. I couldn't get the full picture but the traffic on the frequency was — it was a lot. More than I've heard on any channel since I've been listening."

Gary looked at Diane. Diane looked back. The exchange was two seconds and contained the same arithmetic they'd been doing since the night Jesse brought them Lena's first report, updated with new numbers that made the answer worse.

"How far is the main perimeter from here?" Gary asked.

"Depends on the section. Closest boundary checkpoint is maybe eight miles south. But sound carries out here, especially gunfire."

Jesse was watching his father's face. The look was there — the assessment look, the one that meant the numbers were in and the answer was clear and now the question was what to do about it.

"We need to be ready to move," Gary said. He said it to Diane, but he said it loud enough for Lena to hear and for Jesse to hear and for Lily to hear on her cot with the Walkman in her lap.

Diane nodded once. "Today."

"Today."

---

The sound started at midday.

Jesse heard it first because he was at the south fence, which was where he went when he needed to think. A low, distant stuttering — irregular, percussive, carried on the hot air from the south. It took him three seconds to identify it because he'd never heard it before outside of a movie, and movies got the sound wrong.

Gunfire. Sustained. Miles away but unmistakable once your brain accepted what it was.

He turned and walked fast — not running, not yet — back toward Sector C. By the time he reached the family's area, Gary was already standing, already looking south, already doing the math.

"That's not a supply breach," Gary said.

"No."

The gunfire continued. Not a burst — a conversation. Multiple weapons, different calibers, overlapping. Someone was fighting something, and the something was big enough to require a lot of guns.

Within twenty minutes, the compound changed.

Vehicles started moving on the interior road — not the slow administrative traffic of the last few days but fast, urgent, soldiers in the beds of trucks with their weapons up. Orders were being shouted from the command block, fragments carrying across the open ground: *—all units to the south perimeter — consolidate at the armory — civilians are to remain in their sectors—*

Civilians are to remain in their sectors. Gary heard it. Ruth heard it. Del, who had come to the family's area the moment the gunfire started, heard it.

"That's the word," Del said. "Remain."

"Yeah," Gary said.

"You know what remain means when they're pulling everything south."

"I know what it means."

It meant the civilians were being left inside the wire while the wire stopped being guarded. It meant the consolidation Vasquez had named two days ago was happening now, in real time, and the civilian block was on the wrong side of the new line. It meant remain was a polite word for *you are no longer part of the plan.*

Ruth appeared at the edge of their area. She didn't have the clipboard. She had a canvas bag over one shoulder and a pair of walking shoes on her feet.

"We need to leave," she said. Not a question.

"We need to leave," Gary said.

"How many vehicles do you have access to?"

"Working on it."

---

Gary found Del and pulled him aside, near the water drum where the noise of the compound covered their voices.

"Amy Briars," Gary said. "And her parents. Where are they?"

"Sector B, last I saw. Frank's still moving slow. Carol won't leave his side."

"Find them. Tell them we're moving within the hour. Anyone who wants to come, comes now."

Del nodded and went.

Gary walked to the internal fence — the one with the new padlock on the gate. He stood there for thirty seconds, looking through the chain link at the staging area. Four vehicles, same as Marcus had assessed. A Chevy Suburban, dark green, parked nearest the gate. A Ford Bronco, tan, two spots down. A military deuce-and-a-half that nobody was going to steal without attracting a division's worth of attention. And a Toyota pickup that looked like it hadn't run in a month.

He was still standing there when a hand dropped something into his shirt pocket. Small. Metal. He turned.

Marcus was already walking. Not fast, not slow — the deliberate, unhurried pace of a man who had made his decision and was executing it without theater. He didn't look back. He was carrying a pack over one shoulder and he was heading for the gap in the east fence that the missing guard post had left unmonitored for two days.

Gary reached into his pocket. Keys. A single ring, two keys — ignition and door. A piece of masking tape on the ring with one word written in ballpoint: **Bronco**.

He looked up. Marcus was gone.

Gary pocketed the keys and went back to the family.

---

They moved within the hour. Fifteen minutes to gather everything they had, which wasn't much — the medical supplies Diane could carry, the water jugs, Lily's Walkman, the clothes on their backs. Gary used a tire iron from the maintenance shed on the padlock. Three hits. The chain came apart on the third.

The staging area was fifty yards from the civilian block. Fifty yards of open ground between the fence and the vehicles. In the distance, the gunfire was louder — not closer, necessarily, but more of it, the individual reports merging into a continuous roar that sounded like weather, like a storm front made of metal and violence.

Gary, Diane, Jesse, Lily. Del with Amy, who he'd found alone in Sector B — she'd said her parents were coming but her face said something else. Lena with her notebook and the shortwave. Ruth with the canvas bag and the walking shoes.

Nine people crossing open ground toward two vehicles.

The Bronco was where Marcus had said it would be. Gary got the door open, turned the key — the engine caught on the second try, rough but running. The Suburban was locked. He didn't have keys for it.

"Gary."

Del's voice. Quiet. Urgent.

Gary looked where Del was looking. The east wire — the section where the guard post had been unmanned, where Marcus had slipped through twenty minutes ago. The fence was intact but the gate in the wire was open. Not broken open. Just open, the way a gate is open when the last person through didn't close it behind them.

And through the gate, at the edge of the staging area, maybe sixty yards from where they were standing, there was a woman.

She was wearing a hospital gown. One sleeve was torn off. She was barefoot on the asphalt and she was standing in the particular stillness that Jesse had described to Lena two days ago — not the stillness of a person choosing to stand still but the stillness of a mechanism between inputs. Her head was tilted at an angle that was wrong. Not injured-wrong. Mechanical-wrong. Like a sensor adjusting.

Nobody moved.

"Get in the truck," Gary said. His voice was level. His hands were not.

They loaded. Diane took Lily and put her in the back seat of the Bronco. Lena went in after her. Ruth climbed into the passenger seat without being directed. Jesse stood by the tailgate, watching the woman, unable to stop watching the woman.

"Jesse." Gary's hand on his shoulder. "In. Now."

"There are more."

Gary looked. Behind the woman in the hospital gown, through the open gate, two more shapes were visible at the tree line. Not moving yet. Standing. The same mechanical stillness. The same tilted-head wrongness.

"Get Amy and Del in and get in after them," Gary said. He said it the way he said things when there was no room for the sentence to be heard as anything other than what it was.

Jesse turned. Del was ten feet away with his hand on Amy's arm. Amy was looking past Jesse, past the Bronco, past the east wire — she was looking toward Sector B, where her parents were.

"Amy, we have to go," Jesse said.

"My dad said he was coming. He said ten minutes."

"Amy—"

"He *said ten minutes*." Her voice cracked. The sound it made was not loud but it carried, the way sound carries when the air is still and hot and everything in the compound that should have been making noise had stopped.

The woman in the hospital gown turned her head. Not toward the voice — toward the direction of the voice. The distinction mattered. She didn't hear Amy the way a person hears. She registered the sound the way a weathervane registers wind.

She started walking.

"We need to go right now," Gary said from the driver's seat.

Del looked at Amy. Amy looked at the path between the staging area and Sector B — the fifty yards of open ground they'd just crossed, now with a woman in a hospital gown walking into it and two more shapes at the tree line beginning to move.

"I'm going back," Amy said.

"No." Del's voice.

"My parents are back there."

"I know."

"Then let *go of me*—"

She pulled. Del held. She was sixteen and terrified and stronger than a girl her size should have been because the strength wasn't coming from her muscles, it was coming from the place where a child understands that her parents are going to die and the understanding is not acceptable and the body rejects it the way a body rejects poison — violently, totally, with everything it has.

Del wrapped his arms around her. Both arms, a bear hug, foreman's strength against a teenager's desperate fury. She twisted. She kicked. She threw her weight backward and Del went with her because he wouldn't let go, and his boot caught the concrete lip of the staging area curb and they went down together.

The sound was bad. Del's back hit the asphalt first. Amy's weight came down on top of him, her elbow driving into his left side, and then she rolled off and tried to get up and Del caught her arm again from the ground and pulled her back down and she landed on him again, knee into his ribs, and something in his left side made a sound like a stick breaking under a boot.

Del didn't let go.

He made a sound — a sharp, bitten-off grunt that he turned into words through pure will — "Amy. *Amy.* Your parents would want you in that truck."

She stopped fighting. Not because the words convinced her — because the energy that had been driving her crested and broke the way a wave breaks, all at once, into something that couldn't sustain itself. She went limp in his arms. The sound she made was not screaming and not crying. It was the sound a person makes when the thing they cannot accept becomes the thing they cannot change.

Jesse was there. He got Amy under the arm and lifted — she was his height, lighter, unresisting now. He moved her toward the Bronco and Lena took her, one arm around Amy's shoulders, holding her upright. Amy went where she was put because she had stopped being a person who made decisions and become a person who was carried by the decisions of others.

Jesse turned back to Del.

Del was on his side on the asphalt, one hand pressed against his left ribs, breathing in a way that Jesse recognized from the ER — shallow, controlled, the breathing of someone who has learned in the last ten seconds that deep breaths cost more than they're worth.

"Ribs," Del said.

"Can you walk?"

"Get me up."

The woman in the hospital gown was thirty yards away now. The two from the tree line were in the staging area. Behind them, through the open gate, Jesse could see more shapes at the perimeter of the compound — dark figures moving with the wrong gait through the spaces that the military had left unguarded.

Gary had the Bronco running. Del was still on the ground.

Jesse was trying to get him up — 210 pounds of injured man who couldn't push off his left side without his face going white. Amy was on her feet but not moving, standing where Jesse had left her with her arms at her sides and her eyes on the path back to Sector B. Lena had her by the elbow. Ruth was already in the Bronco, back cargo area, canvas bag between her knees.

"Jesse — get him up, let's go," Gary called from the driver's seat.

"I'm trying—"

Del got his right arm around Jesse's shoulders. Jesse braced and lifted. Del made a sound that he turned into breathing through his teeth. They were upright. They were moving. Ten feet to the passenger door.

And then headlights, from the east fence.

A vehicle coming through the open gate — not fast, picking its way around the shapes at the tree line. An engine that sounded like it had been hot-wired rather than started. The vehicle cleared the gate and the headlights swept the staging area and Jesse saw Marcus behind the wheel of a gray Chevy Suburban — older, road-dirty, sourced from somewhere beyond the fence line during the twenty minutes he'd been gone.

Marcus pulled alongside the Bronco. Rolled down the window. His face was exactly the same as it always was — the alert stillness, the systematic eyes.

"Thought you could use options," he said.

Gary looked at the Suburban. Looked at the Bronco.

"Change of plan," Gary said. "Diane — Suburban with Del. He needs you. Ruth, go with them. Marcus is driving." He looked at Jesse, at Lily pressed against Jesse's chest, at Amy standing blank and hollowed by the tailgate. "Everyone else, with me."

They moved. Thirty seconds of doors opening and bodies shifting while the shapes in the staging area closed the distance. Diane took Del from Jesse — her arm under his, his weight on her, his breathing shallow and bitten-off. She walked him to the Suburban and folded him into the passenger seat. Ruth followed without being told. Marcus already had the engine running.

Gary slid behind the wheel of the Bronco. Jesse lifted Lily into the back — she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her face into his shoulder and didn't make a sound. Lena got Amy in from the other side, guiding her into the seat, then moved to the front passenger seat. Jesse climbed in last, Lily on his lap, and pulled the door shut as the closest shape — not the hospital gown woman, a man, shirtless, with a wound in his abdomen that should have been fatal and clearly wasn't — reached the Bronco's rear bumper.

Gary hit the gas. The Bronco lurched forward. The shirtless man's hand dragged along the tailgate and fell away.

Marcus followed. The Suburban was heavier, slower to respond, but it moved.

Two vehicles. Ten people. The staging area gates were open — the same chain link that Gary had broken with the tire iron twenty minutes ago. The compound road led north to the main gate, which was — Gary didn't know. Guarded, abandoned, blocked. He didn't know.

He pulled alongside the Suburban. Marcus rolled down the window.

"North gate," Marcus said. "Saw it when I was out. They pulled the detail fifteen minutes ago."

Gary looked at him. The man had dropped the keys, walked out, found a vehicle, and come back. No announcement. No negotiation. Just the thing itself, done.

"Thank you," Gary said.

Marcus nodded once and rolled the window up.

The compound road was empty. The military had consolidated south and west — toward the sound, toward the perimeter, toward the fight they were losing. North was unguarded because north, from command's perspective, led further into the zone. Nobody was trying to go further into the zone.

Nobody except ten people in two trucks who understood that the zone was everywhere now and direction was just a choice about which kind of danger you preferred.

The north gate was open. Unmanned. The wire pulled back on both sides like a wound.

Gary took the Bronco through first. Marcus followed. The headlights hit the road beyond — a two-lane blacktop, cracked, with weeds growing through the center line and darkness on both sides. The compound fell away behind them. The sound of the distant battle faded to a murmur, then to nothing, replaced by the sound of engines and tires and the wind through windows that nobody had thought to close.

In the back seat of the Bronco, Lily sat on Jesse's lap. She was shaking — a fine, continuous tremor that ran through her whole body like a current. Jesse held her the way their father had held him on the porch eight days ago, both arms, too tight, not letting go. She pressed her face into his shirt and the Walkman dug into his ribs and he didn't move it.

Amy was next to them, pressed against the door, her forehead on the glass. She was looking backward. Through the rear window, the compound was a cluster of lights going dark, one by one, like a body shutting down. She watched until there was nothing left to watch and then she kept looking at the place where it had been.

Lena sat in the passenger seat with the notebook in her lap, closed. She wasn't writing. Some things you sit with before you record them.

In the Suburban, Diane had one hand on Del's shoulder and the other pressing the side of his rib cage, feeling for the break through his shirt. Del breathed the way she told him to breathe — slow, shallow, through the nose. Ruth sat behind them and said nothing because Ruth understood that silence, right now, was the most useful thing she had.

Marcus drove. His eyes moved between the road and the mirrors and the tree line and the road again, the systematic scan of a man who had spent his professional life knowing which direction trouble came from. Gary didn't ask where Marcus had found the second Suburban. Marcus didn't explain. Some things didn't need language. They needed a road and two working engines and the agreement that forward was better than any direction behind them.

The road went north. The sky was purple-black. The stars were wrong — filtered through whatever was in the atmosphere, dimmer than they should have been, like looking at the sky through dirty glass.

Behind them, Harlan went dark.

Ahead of them, the road.
