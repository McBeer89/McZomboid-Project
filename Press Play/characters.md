## 🪖 Morrow's Squad

---

### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 38
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Six foot even, built like someone who used to be bigger and has been burning it off from the inside. Dark hair going gray at the temples, cut close. A face that has spent too much time in the sun over too many years — lined around the eyes, rough at the jaw. He moves with the deliberate economy of a man who learned long ago that wasted motion costs something. His left sleeve is rolled down and buttoned at the wrist regardless of the heat.

**History:**
Born in Dothan, Alabama, the second of four kids. His father worked the line at a peanut processing plant; his mother kept the house and the peace. Dale enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available to him and he understood, even then, that he needed structure the way some people need water. He was good at it — good enough to make sergeant by twenty-six, good enough to keep it. He has been stationed at Fort Knox since 1990. He has a daughter in Georgia he calls every Sunday. He has not been able to call since July 1st.

**The Scratch:**
Received the morning of July 8th during a perimeter sweep near West Point. A civilian came out of a house without warning. Her fingernails caught the inside of his forearm as she fell — three short lines, nothing that needed stitches.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Morrow formally reported his scratch to Greer in Chapter 9. Greer had already reviewed the situation with Harlan's CO — command's perimeter intelligence over four days is consistent with what Morrow and Diane observed: transmission is not contact-dependent. The scratch is not a reportable exposure under current operational assessment. Morrow knows that command knows, which changes the weight of what he's been carrying. The gap between operational knowledge and official position — as Greer named it — is the thread that carries forward.

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, stocky, with hands that always look dirty even when they aren't. Brown hair cut to regulation, a broad flat face that defaults to neutral. Sweats constantly and doesn't seem to notice. Has a habit of wiping his palms on his thighs before touching anything mechanical, like a ritual.

**History:**
Grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Took his first engine apart at fourteen — a lawn mower, then a neighbor's Buick, then anything that held still long enough. Enlisted because the Army would pay him to do the only thing he was genuinely good at. He is not ideological about service. He does the job.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Inside Harlan, back within the institutional structure. Gary connected him to Ruth in Chapter 7 to look at Generator Three, which was running rough. The clearing where he found the F-150 remains unspoken. Peripheral in the Harlan arc but available — particularly relevant when vehicles become the story again.

---

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Slight, sandy-haired, with the open unguarded face of someone who hasn't yet learned to close it. Freckled across the nose and cheeks. Always doing something small with his hands. Looks younger than twenty.

**History:**
From Elizabethtown, Kentucky — twenty minutes outside the exclusion zone. Enlisted eight months ago. This is his first posting.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> His mother and younger brother are inside the exclusion zone. He was supposed to go home for his mother's birthday on July 12th. That date has passed. He has told no one. This thread is loaded and has not been pulled yet.

---

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, designated marksman

**Physical Description:**
Lean and dark, with close-cropped black hair and eyes that don't settle. Not tall, but occupies a considered amount of space. A scar along the left side of his jaw he has never explained. Almost always at the periphery of wherever the group is.

**History:**
Grew up in San Antonio, the son of a retired Army staff sergeant. Two prior deployments — Panama, '89, and a brief unremarked assignment in '91.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Inside Harlan, peripheral. Disclosed the forty-second reanimation window to Vasquez and Diane on the road — that information is now fully in the operational picture. Jesse has been studying him since Chapter 1 as part of his curriculum. No new significant threads opened in the Harlan arc yet.

---

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Tall and angular, with a long neck and eyes set a little too far apart. Still growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, tends to stand half a step behind whoever is nearest.

**History:**
From rural Indiana. Arrived at Fort Knox forty-eight hours before the phones went dead. Has been in-country for his entire military career.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Was with Cutler in the clearing where the F-150 was found. Carrying what he saw there. The half-second vacancy Jesse identified has not resolved. Whether it does or doesn't is still open.

---

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Status:** Deceased. Died of illness in the truck bed on the morning of July 10th while the group was clearing the road obstruction on Route 9. Lieutenant Greer handled the situation personally. Logged administratively upon arrival at Harlan — a form, a separate board, two sentences. He had a girlfriend named Janet in Memphis who does not know.

---

## 🪖 Greer's Unit

---

### First Lieutenant Paul Greer
**Age:** 27
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11A Infantry Officer

**Physical Description:**
Medium height and lean, with the upright bearing of someone who earned it through ROTC and has maintained it through conviction. Brown hair, regulation cut. Still clean-shaven. A face young enough to be readable — you can see him processing things if you watch closely enough.

**History:**
Grew up in Cincinnati. Eagle Scout. ROTC at Ohio State, commissioned 1989, promoted to first lieutenant eighteen months ago. Stationed at Fort Knox since 1991.

**The Two Missing Soldiers:**
Greer's unit departed Fort Knox with six personnel. It arrived at the back road with four.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Revealed in Chapter 9: Private Mitchell died of fever on the night of July 7th — no bite — and reanimated within the minute. Greer handled Mitchell. Pawlowski died in the encounter with Mitchell. Briggs handled the immediate situation with Pawlowski, then Greer handled Pawlowski. The CO's after-action report records both as lost to hostile engagement, which is technically true and operationally incomplete. Greer named this distinction explicitly to Morrow and took accountability for it without performing it. Briggs was present for both and has not spoken of it since. Greer has not asked him to. This thread is in the record but its full cost has not yet been paid.
>
> Inside Harlan, absorbed into the command structure. His relationship with Gary is formalized — road equality is gone. Managing what is in the record about Morrow's scratch carefully: no lies, deliberate omissions. The gap between operational knowledge and official position will close, and when it does the calculus changes for everyone inside the wire.

### Sergeant First Class Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 34
**Branch:** US Army, Active Duty
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman, senior NCO

**Physical Description:**
Compact and direct, dark hair pulled back tight, brown eyes that move constantly. A small scar on her right knuckles she doesn't explain. Moves without telegraphing. Does not fill silence.

**History:**
Grew up in El Paso. Fifteen years in the Army.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> The Vasquez/Diane friendship is the primary thread for her in the Harlan arc. Found Diane at the medical station in Chapter 8 — first name basis established, the weight in "any time" registered clearly. She is watching the military side of the wire and will begin leaning toward Gary and Diane as the situation deteriorates. She is the clearest thinker in the group and also the person most likely to be the last one anyone notices is carrying something she hasn't said yet.

---

### Specialist Darnell Cross
**Age:** 23
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Broad-shouldered, unhurried, with a stillness that reads as confidence. Always checks his bootlaces before moving — left one first.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Inside Harlan. Steady. Background presence. No new threads.

---

### Private First Class Owen Briggs
**Age:** 20
**Branch:** US Army
**MOS:** 11B Infantryman

**Physical Description:**
Medium height, fair-skinned with blond hair. The half-second vacancy in his eyes.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Was present for both deaths of the missing soldiers — handled the immediate situation with Pawlowski before Greer finished it. Has not spoken of it. Greer has not asked him to. Whatever is stored will not stay stored indefinitely. Jesse has identified his vacancy as a category of thing alongside Webb's, without yet knowing the cause.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

**Physical Description:**
A big man gone thick through the middle, broad shoulders that haven't softened with the rest of him. Thick forearms, permanently rough hands. Short graying hair kept neat out of habit. A face that has practiced patience so long it has set that way. Work boots, jeans, short-sleeve button shirt, every day, like a uniform.

**History:**
Born in Hardin County, grew up fifty miles from where he lives now. Two years in the Army Reserve in his early twenties. Married Diane in 1974. Built Hutchins Electric from a truck and a license into a four-man operation. Has been quietly preparing since 1987 — not from ideology, but from the bone-deep suspicion of a practical man who read the world and didn't like what it was telling him.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Inside Harlan as a civilian — no rank, no formal standing. Managing the friction of that shift by finding practical work through Ruth. Connected with Del Norris — intelligence confirmed: the perimeter isn't opening, indefinite containment orders, soldiers shot going over the wire. Has clocked Marcus and his vehicle inventory; filed as *useful or problem, category unresolved*. Received Lena's intelligence through Jesse in Chapter 9 and identified the CDC retraction as the critical piece — deliberate concealment, not institutional failure. The arithmetic keeps coming out the same way. Running tab is long. Has not settled it yet.

---

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38
**Occupation (pre-collapse):** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

**Physical Description:**
Compact and capable-looking, dark hair in a practical knot. Sharp brown eyes that assess before they engage. Moves without waste.

**History:**
Grew up in Elizabethtown. Studied nursing in Louisville, met Gary in 1973, married him the following year. Eleven years in the ER at Cortman Medical. Was there on July 3rd when it stopped being a hospital.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Working the medical station. Went despite the cost — walking back into a medical context after Cortman asked something of her that she paid at the supply shelf in Chapter 8: alone, thirty seconds, then back to work. That's who she is. First name basis with Vasquez established; the weight in "any time" received and understood. The Gary/Diane scene in Chapter 7 opened her interiority — the woman in the hallway at Cortman, Janet in Memphis, the running tab. She carries more knowledge about the outbreak's mechanism than almost anyone in the civilian population. Frank Briars is her patient; the parallel family connection begins through the medical station.

---

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16

**Physical Description:**
His father's height, still lean, dark hair worn a little long. A face that has been transparent his whole life and is learning, unevenly, to close. Dark circles.

**History:**
Born 1977. Was in Muldraugh on July 4th when the emergency rooms turned violent. Walked eight miles home alone, after dark. Has not talked about what he saw on the way.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> The Jesse/Lena dynamic is moving faster than expected, which is right for who they both are. She is using him as a trusted relay for information; he is using her as the next chapter of his curriculum. He reported Lena's intelligence to Gary in Chapter 9 — sequentially, without editorializing, the way Gary taught him. The *okay* exchange that closes Chapter 9 is a confirmation of shared understanding — they are doing the same arithmetic and arriving at the same answer. He has identified Briggs' and Webb's vacancies as a category of thing without knowing the cause. Amy Briars is in his peripheral — that thread has not been pulled yet. A moment that tests what he's built is still coming.

---

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7

**Physical Description:**
Small for her age, her mother's dark eyes, her father's jaw when she sets it. Hair in two braids. Carries a yellow Sony Walkman. The tape has run out. She presses play anyway.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Found Amy Briars on her own initiative in Chapter 8 — her small adventure, her version of the curriculum. The Walkman tape running as shared silence is their first real moment together. Amy's past-tense slip about her mother is in the record, unresolved. Ruth noticed the Walkman in Chapter 7 — that thread is planted. Lily is paying more attention than anyone wants her to be, and she is doing it quietly.

---

## 🏚️ Harlan Civilians

---

### Ruth
**Age:** Late 50s
**Background:** Her father ran a plumbing operation in Bowling Green for thirty years. Something in her past explains why she took charge without being asked and doesn't expect thanks for it. Not yet revealed.

**Description:** De facto organizer of the civilian block. Been at Harlan since July 7th. Practical, unsentimental, past the point of softening things. Tells new arrivals what they need to know before they ask. Keeps a clipboard. Records everything.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Established in Chapters 7 and 8. Connected Gary to Del Norris. Sent Diane to the medical station. Noticed Lily's Walkman — thread planted, developing naturally. Lena named a key distinction about her in Chapter 9: Ruth manages what people are *ready for*, not just what they know. Her backstory has not been given yet. She is an anchor for the civilian block and a foil for Gary.

---

### Marcus
**Age:** Mid-30s
**Background:** From Louisville. Connected to a well-established local criminal underground — not organized crime in the traditional sense, more a hidden network with deep roots. His specialty was vehicle theft. Alone at Harlan.

**Description:** Alert stillness. Eyes that move systematically. Never wastes a position. Vague about his past and specific about what he's seen.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Gary caught him conducting a professional vehicle assessment on the civilian staging area in Chapter 9 — door handles, ignition columns, tolerances. Marcus told Gary straight rather than concealing it. Has assessed four vehicles as worth driving. The arrangement between them is implicit: his skillset is an asset when vehicles become the story again. Both of them know it. The *useful or problem* category is open by design. His complication — the thing he does that puts the group in danger — is still ahead.

---

### Lena Park
**Age:** Late 20s
**Background:** Reporter, Louisville Courier-Journal. Korean-American. Was in Knox County covering the "flu story" before the blockade went up and found herself inside it. At Harlan since July 8th.

**Description:** Still, attentive, reads every room. Asks questions smaller than they sound. Has been talking to everyone in the civilian block since arrival and assembling a picture more complete than what anyone has been told officially. Carries a notebook and a portable shortwave radio.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Jesse/Lena dynamic established in Chapter 8, deepened in Chapter 9. She delivered the global picture to Jesse: WHO flight grounding, European border closures, DC riots, the CDC retraction and its implications, the Knox Telecommunications/Raleigh connection. She is calibrating what to tell him and in what order. Jesse relayed it to Gary. More information is coming through her that has not been given yet. Will cause friction with military command.

---

### Del Norris
**Age:** Mid-50s
**Background:** Warehouse foreman, south Louisville. Drove into the zone July 5th to check on his mother, couldn't get back out. Made it to Harlan on foot. Has been here four days.

**Description:** Broad across the shoulders, foreman's hands, close-cropped gray hair. A particular exhausted fury — past panic, into something colder and more useful.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Gary/Del friendship established in Chapter 9. Del delivered key intelligence: indefinite containment orders, soldiers shot going over the wire to their families, six hours watching the blockade from outside. Confirmed Gary's arithmetic. Carries something about the Louisville side of the story that has not been delivered yet. The friendship is two practical men who have stopped being surprised and started being angry in the productive direction.

---

### Frank Briars
**Age:** Late 40s
**Background:** Farmer, rural stretch between West Point and the zone's eastern edge. Came in with wife Carol and daughter Amy.

**Description:** Wide-faced, patient, the resigned pragmatism of someone who knows cooperation is faster than resistance.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Introduced through Diane's medical station arc in Chapter 8 — glass laceration wound infection, early-stage, manageable. Diane is treating him. The parallel family connection begins here. Will be up and around Sector B when recovered.

---

### Carol Briars
**Age:** Late 40s
**Background:** Frank's wife. Farmer.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Not yet directly introduced. Present in the background. Development pending.

---

### Amy Briars
**Age:** 16
**Background:** Daughter of Frank and Carol.

**Description:** Dark blond hair in a loose braid. Patient, available in the way of someone who has exhausted the options and arrived at stillness as what remains.

> **⚠️ Where They Stand — Spoilers Below**
> Found by Lily in Chapter 8 — Lily's small adventure. The Walkman tape running as shared silence is their first real moment. Amy's past-tense slip about her mother is in the record, unresolved. Her dynamic with Jesse is more complicated — two sixteen-year-olds shaped by the same week in ways they don't know how to compare yet. That thread has not been pulled.
