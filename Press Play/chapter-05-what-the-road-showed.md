# Chapter Five — *"What the Road Showed"*

**July 10, 1993 — Knox County, Knox Exclusion Zone**

---

Jesse watched Knox County through the passenger window and tried to find the language for what he was seeing.

He was in the cab with Gary and Cutler, Lily wedged between him and the door with the Walkman in her lap, the tape running on whichever side had something left on it — a faint mechanical hiss leaking from the headphone she had pressed against her ear, the other ear open to the truck. Outside, the logging road had given way to a county route and the county route had given way to the kind of two-lane state road that ran between towns in Kentucky and connected them without particularly caring about either. The kind of road Jesse had driven with his father a hundred times, the kind where you knew the landmarks — the grain elevator at the Pruitt farm, the hand-painted sign for Darlene's Pies, the small white church with the marquee that usually said something about Jesus and right now said COME IN WE ARE OPEN in letters that had been up since before anyone stopped coming.

The church doors were open. He could see that as they passed. Open and dark inside the way of a place that has not been closed but has been left.

That was the word, he thought. *Left.* Everything looked left. The sprinkler running in a front yard with no one to see it, throwing a slow arc of water across a lawn that was already getting shaggy at the edges, the spray catching the morning light and making a small rainbow over a garden hose that snaked back to a spigot someone had turned on and walked away from. A bicycle on its side in a driveway, the back wheel still spinning very slowly in a way that meant it hadn't been there long or meant the wind had caught it or meant something else entirely, and Jesse found he couldn't look at the back wheel for very long. A school bus pulled to the shoulder with its hazard lights still blinking, yellow, patient, waiting for a schedule that no longer existed. A mailbox with its flag up, an envelope visible in the slot — someone had put out the mail. Someone had written a letter and put it in the box and raised the flag and expected someone to come pick it up.

The county had been left in the middle of itself. That was the thing. Not destroyed — not yet, not most of it — just stopped. As if someone had pressed pause on an ordinary Tuesday in July and the picture was still up on the screen with the cursor blinking. The destruction would come, Jesse understood that now. He had learned it the way he'd learned everything this week — by watching, by listening, by assembling the pattern from the pieces. The destruction was already here, in the sprinkler and the mailbox and the school bus, in the gap between what these things meant last week and what they meant now. It just hadn't finished arriving yet.

"Don't look at everything," Gary said.

Jesse looked at him.

"Look at the road. The sides of the road. Things that move." He said it without taking his eyes off the windshield, his hands at ten and two, his jaw set in the way Jesse had learned to read as *I'm holding something down and the holding is the work.* "Everything else is going to be there when this is over."

Jesse turned back to the window. He looked at the road and the sides of the road. Things that moved. He practiced it the way he'd been practicing other things this week — Reyes in the tree line, the way the soldier's eyes swept a fixed arc at fixed intervals without variation or fatigue. Briggs with his eyes going somewhere else, leaving the present, and the way Morrow brought him back with a word or a look. His father's arm extended in the road and the specific calm of the voice that came after it — not the calm of a man who wasn't afraid, but the calm of a man who had decided that being afraid and being still could exist in the same body at the same time. He was building a curriculum from the people around him and nobody had told him to and nobody had told him not to.

Lily put her head on his shoulder. He let her. Her hair smelled like sweat and pine sap and the particular staleness of a child who has been carried and held and passed from person to person for days, the smell not unpleasant but specific, the smell of his sister in the middle of whatever this was.

In the truck bed behind them, through the rear window, he could see the shape of Hicks under the blue tarp they had folded into a pad, and Reyes sitting against the side wall facing east with his rifle across his knees, and Diane with her knees up and her hand on Hicks' wrist checking the pulse she'd been checking every ten minutes, and Vasquez beside her watching the road behind them the way she watched everything — steady, measuring, cataloguing.

The cab of the truck smelled like old fast food wrappers and someone's pine air freshener that had given up months ago and the particular smell of people who had been outside in July for several days without access to a shower. A Hardee's bag was crumpled in the footwell by Jesse's feet, and a receipt curled on the dashboard — someone's breakfast from a morning when breakfast was something you bought at a window and didn't think about. Jesse had stopped noticing the smell within the first ten minutes. He had not stopped noticing the receipt.

The road was mostly clear. Mostly. There were cars pulled to the shoulder in ones and twos, doors ajar, a minivan stopped sideways across the centerline that Cutler navigated around without comment. There were things in the road that Cutler steered around without comment — shapes that Jesse's eyes registered and his mind refused to hold, the curriculum failing him for the first time, the practice of looking-at-what-moves not built for the things that had stopped moving. He looked at the road and the sides of the road and not at those.

After twenty minutes, a dog appeared.

It was a big dog — some kind of shepherd mix, brown and black, standing in the middle of the lane with its head level and its ears forward. Not aggressive. Not frightened. Just standing, the way it might have stood in its own yard waiting for someone to come home. A collar around its neck, red, the tag catching the light. Cutler slowed and the dog watched them approach and when the truck was ten feet away it stepped to the shoulder and sat down and watched them pass with an expression that was hard to read and easy to feel.

Lily lifted her head and turned in the seat to watch it through the back window.

"It's okay," Jesse said.

"Is it."

He looked at the dog receding in the side mirror, sitting in the road, watching the truck go. Waiting for a thing that wasn't coming back. Knowing it or not knowing it, and Jesse couldn't decide which was worse.

"It'll be okay," he said. The amendment sat between them for a moment and he let it.

Reyes had not planned to say it on the road.

He had thought, in the abstract way he thought about most things — practical, sequenced, stripped of sentiment — that he would say it when it became necessary to say it. When the information had operational value. When not saying it created more risk than saying it. He had been saying that to himself since July 8th and the conditions had not been met, or he had been determining that the conditions had not been met, which was possibly the same thing and possibly wasn't.

Hicks moved under the tarp beside him. Not dramatically — just the restless small movements of a body managing pain, the adjustment and re-adjustment of someone who could not find a position that worked. The truck bed was hot — the metal floor conducting the engine heat and the sun's heat together into a surface that burned through cloth — and Hicks was on the tarp but the tarp was thin and the heat was getting through it the way the fever was getting through everything else. Reyes had been watching him for forty minutes with the same flat attention he brought to everything, cataloguing the respiration rate, the intervals between movements, the way the hands opened and closed on nothing.

Diane checked the wrist. Put the back of her hand to the forehead. Said something low that Reyes didn't catch over the road noise and the rattle of the loose exhaust. Hicks answered with something Reyes also didn't catch and then was still for a while.

Reyes looked at the road behind them. Empty. The asphalt unspooling in the heat haze, the trees on either side blurring into a green wall at distance. Good.

"Vasquez," he said.

She looked at him.

"What I saw on the road from West Point."

Her expression did not change. She had been waiting for this since he'd said it to Shores, which Shores had apparently been constitutionally incapable of keeping to himself. She settled her weight slightly, the adjustment of someone preparing to receive information and do something with it.

"Day before yesterday," he said. "We were moving south from West Point on the 31. Came through a neighborhood on the east side — residential, single family, the kind with the long driveways." He said it without inflection, the way you gave a report. "There was a man in the road. He'd been there a while. I could tell from the — from the position." He paused. The pause was the only part that wasn't report cadence. "No visible bite. No injury. He was dressed for mowing the lawn. Gloves, hat. He'd come out to mow his lawn and he'd died in the road."

Vasquez said nothing. Diane had gone still. She was listening with the quality of attention that Reyes had learned to recognize in the last two days — the nurse's listening, the kind that heard through words to the data underneath.

"He got up while I was watching him," Reyes said. "Took about forty seconds from the time I spotted him. He'd been down when I saw him — I watched him reanimate. Watched the whole thing." He said it flat because flat was the only way to say it. The alternative was the feeling that came with it and the feeling was not useful.

The truck moved through the morning. Hicks breathed.

"I've seen three other cases," Reyes said. "Two of them bite cases, which is what we were told to expect. One of them was a woman in a parking lot on the 9th — she had a cardiac event. I saw it happen. She went down, and eight minutes later she was up."

"Forty seconds," Vasquez said. "The man in the road."

"Forty seconds from first movement to standing. He'd been down longer — I don't know how long."

"Less than a minute," Diane said. Quiet, like she was confirming something she'd been carrying for a while — not new information but a new data point in the same terrible pattern. "That's what I saw at Cortman. And I heard the same from someone in the waiting room on the second — he'd been on shortwave all night. Said it was consistent. Under a minute from the time they went down."

Vasquez looked at her.

"Zero to one minute from death," Diane said. "That's the window." She held Vasquez's eyes. "Which means anybody who dies in this truck—"

"Becomes a problem in this truck," Vasquez said. Flat, factual, the completion of the sentence that needed completing.

Nobody said anything for a moment. The road ran under them, cracked asphalt and the occasional lurch where a season of frost had heaved a section up. The wind in the truck bed caught the edge of the tarp and flapped it, a sound like a flag in a wind that should have been ordinary and wasn't.

Reyes looked at Hicks.

Diane looked at Hicks.

Vasquez looked at the road behind them.

"He knows," Diane said. Quietly. "I think he's known for a while."

Reyes had thought so too. The particular quality of a man's silence when he has understood something about his situation and is deciding how to hold it — not denial, not acceptance, but the space between where you sit with the fact of yourself and wait for the rest to follow. He had seen it before, in other situations, in other people who were at the end of their options and knew it. It looked like stillness. It looked like patience. It was neither.

"We tell Greer," Vasquez said. "About the window."

"He needs to be able to plan around it," Reyes agreed.

"When we stop."

"When we stop."

The truck ran east and the county ran past them on both sides, left in the middle of itself, the sprinklers and the open doors and the patient yellow blink of a hazard light somewhere behind them now, and Hicks breathed his labored breath under the blue tarp and the morning kept heating up.

The roadblock was not military.

That was the first thing Cutler registered when they came around the long curve on Route 9 and found it — not the block itself, three vehicles arranged across the road in a rough chevron with the deliberateness of people who had thought about it, but the absence of uniforms. Civilian clothes. Four people visible, two more shapes behind the vehicles that might be people or might be shadow, and a hand-painted sign on cardboard propped against the center truck that said STOP.

Cutler stopped.

Gary had his window down before the truck was fully still. Old instinct — the same instinct that put his back to walls and his eyes on approaches, the Reserve training surfacing again, telling him that a closed vehicle was a box and a box was a trap and the first thing you did was give yourself a way out.

Greer was out of the truck before Gary, because Greer was the kind of man who did not wait to see what other people decided to do first. He came around the hood with his hands visible — not raised, just forward and open, the deliberate posture of someone who had decided what signal to send before he sent it.

The four visible people were watching him with the particular wariness of people who had been wrong about who to trust recently and were building new policy around it. One of them had a shotgun. One had what looked like a deer rifle. The other two had tools — a crowbar, a length of pipe — in the way of people who had improvised and knew that improvised was not enough but was what they had.

Gary got out.

Cutler stayed behind the wheel, engine running.

"We're moving through," Greer said. Clear, even, not loud. "We've got wounded in the truck bed and children in the cab. We're not looking for trouble."

"Where you headed," said the one with the shotgun. A woman, Gary registered. Fifties, gray-haired, her hair pulled back in a knot that had been practical three days ago and was now just what hadn't been taken down since. The shotgun was held the way someone held it who knew how — elbow in, stock against the hip, the barrel not pointing at anyone but not pointing away either. She wore a flannel shirt over a t-shirt despite the heat, the sleeves rolled to the elbows, and Gary noticed the bruise on her forearm — dark, days old, the shape of a handprint.

"East," Greer said.

"How far east."

"Far enough to be out of the county."

A pause. The woman looked at the truck — at the cab, the bed, the configuration of people, counting, assessing. Gary watched her do it. She was good at it. She had learned it the same place everyone was learning it — from the week, from the necessity, from the space where competence either arrived or didn't.

"Army," she said.

"Yes, ma'am."

"You're the fourth group of Army we've seen in three days. First three kept moving." She paused. "Didn't stop. Didn't say anything."

"I'm stopping," Greer said. "I'm saying something."

She looked at him. Gary looked at her looking at him, at the thing being decided in the space between them, the calculation of whether to trust a twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant who had stopped his truck and was standing in the road with his hands open. The calculation was not about Greer's rank or his uniform or his words. It was about the stopping. The three groups before him had kept moving and that was the data she had, and now this one had stopped, and the stopping was the only thing that mattered.

"We've got twenty-three people," she said. "This crossroads, three houses back, the church." She nodded at something behind the block. "Elderly. Kids. Someone with a broken arm we set ourselves because there's nobody else."

"I know," Greer said. Not dismissive. Not promising anything. Just acknowledging the shape of what she was carrying.

"We're not being moved on," she said. "We tried to move. People didn't make it." A pause. Short, controlled, the pause of a woman who was not going to explain what *didn't make it* meant and did not need to. "This is where we are."

"Then this is where you are," Greer said. "We're not here to move you."

Gary watched the woman's face. Watched the recalculation. Watched the shotgun's angle shift two degrees toward the ground in the way of something that wasn't a decision yet but was a possibility.

"You got medical," she said. Looking past Greer at the truck, at the shape of the bed. At Diane, who had appeared at the side of the truck and was just standing there — not performing, not signaling, just present in the way that read as *nurse* to anyone who'd been in a hospital or an emergency or a room where someone was hurt and needed someone who knew what to do.

"Yes," Greer said.

A pause. A long pause.

"The broken arm," Diane said, from the side of the truck. "Can I look at it."

The woman with the shotgun looked at her for a long moment. Then she looked back at Greer. Then back at Diane. Something in her face shifted — not trust, not yet, but the allowance that trust might be possible, the door opened an inch.

"Yeah," she said. "Alright."

It cost them forty minutes. Diane looked at the arm — a man named Gerald, sixty-one, sitting on a porch step two houses back from the roadblock with his left arm held against his chest in a makeshift sling cut from a bedsheet. He had set his own radius fracture on July 7th with the help of his neighbor and a piece of lumber, and the splint was wrong — too tight at the wrist, too loose at the elbow, the kind of mistake that came from courage rather than knowledge. He was in more pain than he was admitting and his color was not right — pale at the lips, the gray undertone that meant circulation was being compromised.

She re-splinted it properly with materials from the kit in Morrow's pack, working quickly, her hands steady and sure, talking Gerald through each step in the voice she used with patients who were in pain and trying not to show it — even, specific, the voice that said *this is what's happening and this is what comes next* so that the patient's mind had something to hold onto besides the pain. She gave him two aspirin from the same kit and told him the color was from the initial injury and should resolve and told him what to watch for if it didn't.

She didn't tell him what to do if something happened to him. The sentence had a shape and she could feel it pressing against her teeth and she did not say it because there was nothing useful in the saying.

Gary stayed by the truck. He watched Greer move through the group of twenty-three people with the particular energy of a man who had been given a task that fit his framework and was executing it without remainder — shaking hands, listening, not making promises he couldn't keep but making the ones he could. The frequency for Harlan. The direction east. The assurance that someone at the other end of the radio might answer. He watched Greer crouch down and talk to a child who was maybe nine years old with the focused attention of a man who had time for it, even though he didn't, even though the truck was running and Hicks was in the bed and the road was waiting.

Morrow came up beside him.

"He's good at this," Gary said.

"Yes," Morrow said.

"You worried about when he can't be."

Morrow was quiet for a moment. "I'm worried about the gap between when he stops being good at it and when he realizes he's stopped."

Gary watched Greer with the child. The child said something. Greer laughed — genuinely, quickly, the way people laughed in July 1993 when something was briefly and unexpectedly funny and the laughter came from the part of you that hadn't been updated yet. Then the laugh was over and they were back in the day.

"We're leaving them," Gary said. Flat. Placing it.

"We can't take twenty-three people to Harlan in an F-150."

"I know that."

"He knows that."

"I know he does." Gary looked at the crossroads, at the hand-painted sign, at the church in the middle distance with its marquee still reading COME IN WE ARE OPEN. Twenty-three people at a crossroads with a cardboard sign and a woman with a shotgun and a man with a broken arm that a nurse had re-splinted because the nurse's truck had happened to come this way instead of another way. The arithmetic of who you helped and who you drove past and whether the distinction was anything other than proximity. "Doesn't mean it's nothing."

"No," Morrow said. "It doesn't mean that."

They left the people at the crossroads with four days of military rations from the pack Greer had split without discussion, two aspirin bottles, Diane's instructions for Gerald, and the frequency for Checkpoint Harlan's radio which Greer had written on the back of the cardboard sign in black marker and handed back to the woman with the shotgun.

She had looked at it for a moment. Then she'd looked at Greer.

"If we get through," he said, "I'll send someone back."

She had not said she believed him. She had not said she didn't. She'd folded the cardboard and put it in her pocket and stepped to the shoulder and watched them drive through the gap they'd made in the chevron, the shotgun at her side, the other hand in the pocket where the cardboard was.

Jesse watched her in the side mirror as they pulled away. She stood in the road until the truck curved out of sight — a gray-haired woman with a shotgun and a folded piece of cardboard and twenty-three people behind her and the road ahead empty.

He watched until she was gone.

"Dad," he said.

"I know," Gary said.

Lily pressed play on the Walkman. This time it was the blank hiss of the end of the tape, running on, running on, and she didn't press stop.
