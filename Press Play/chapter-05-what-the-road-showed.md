# Chapter Five: What the Road Showed

*Knox County, Kentucky. July 10, 1993. Late morning.*

---

## I.

Jesse watched Knox County through the passenger window and tried to find the language for what he was seeing.

He was in the cab with Gary and Cutler, Lily wedged between him and the door with the Walkman in her lap, the tape running on whichever side had something left on it. Outside, the logging road had given way to a county route and the county route had given way to the kind of two-lane state road that ran between towns in Kentucky and connected them without particularly caring about either. The kind of road Jesse had driven with his father a hundred times, the kind where you knew the landmarks — the grain elevator at the Pruitt farm, the hand-painted sign for Darlene's Pies, the small white church with the marquee that usually said something about Jesus and right now said COME IN WE ARE OPEN in letters that had been up since before anyone stopped coming.

The church doors were open. He could see that as they passed. Open and dark inside the way of a place that has not been closed but has been left.

That was the word, he thought. Left. Everything looked left. The sprinkler running in a front yard with no one to see it, throwing a slow arc of water across a lawn that was already getting shaggy at the edges. A bicycle on its side in a driveway, the back wheel still spinning very slowly in a way that meant it hadn't been there long or meant the wind had caught it or meant something else entirely, and Jesse found he couldn't look at the back wheel for very long. A school bus pulled to the shoulder with its hazard lights still blinking, yellow, patient, waiting for a schedule that no longer existed.

The county had been left in the middle of itself. That was the thing. Not destroyed — not yet, not most of it — just stopped. As if someone had pressed pause on an ordinary Tuesday in July and the picture was still up on the screen with the cursor blinking.

"Don't look at everything," Gary said.

Jesse looked at him.

"Look at the road. The sides of the road. Things that move." He said it without taking his eyes off the windshield. "Everything else is going to be there when this is over."

Jesse turned back to the window. He looked at the road and the sides of the road. Things that moved. He practiced it the way he'd been practicing other things this week — Reyes in the tree line, Briggs with his eyes going somewhere else, his father's arm extended in the road and the specific calm of the voice that came after it. He was building a curriculum from the people around him and nobody had told him to and nobody had told him not to.

Lily put her head on his shoulder. He let her.

In the truck bed behind them, through the rear window, he could see the shape of Hicks under the blue tarp they had folded into a pad, and Reyes sitting against the side wall facing east, and Diane with her knees up and her hand on Hicks' wrist, and Vasquez beside her watching the road behind them the way she watched everything — steady, measuring, cataloguing.

The cab of the truck smelled like old fast food wrappers and someone's pine air freshener that had given up months ago and the particular smell of people who had been outside in July for several days without access to a shower. Jesse had stopped noticing it within the first ten minutes.

The road was mostly clear. Mostly. There were cars pulled to the shoulder in ones and twos, doors ajar, a minivan stopped sideways across the centerline that Cutler navigated around without comment. There were things in the road that Cutler steered around without comment. Jesse looked at the road and the sides of the road and not at those.

After twenty minutes, a dog appeared.

It was a big dog — some kind of shepherd mix, brown and black, standing in the middle of the lane with its head level and its ears forward. Not aggressive. Not frightened. Just standing. Cutler slowed and the dog watched them approach and when the truck was ten feet away it stepped to the shoulder and sat down and watched them pass with an expression that was hard to read and easy to feel.

Lily lifted her head and turned in the seat to watch it through the back window.

"It's okay," Jesse said.

"Is it."

He looked at the dog receding in the side mirror, sitting in the road, watching the truck go.

"It'll be okay," he said. The amendment sat between them for a moment and he let it.

## II.

Reyes had not planned to say it on the road.

He had thought, in the abstract way he thought about most things — practical, sequenced, stripped of sentiment — that he would say it when it became necessary to say it. When the information had operational value. When not saying it created more risk than saying it. He had been saying that to himself since July 8th and the conditions had not been met, or he had been determining that the conditions had not been met, which was possibly the same thing and possibly wasn't.

Hicks moved under the tarp beside him. Not dramatically — just the restless small movements of a body managing pain, the adjustment and re-adjustment of someone who could not find a position that worked. Reyes had been watching him for forty minutes with the same flat attention he brought to everything.

Diane checked the wrist. Put the back of her hand to the forehead. Said something low that Reyes didn't catch over the road noise. Hicks answered with something Reyes also didn't catch and then was still for a while.

Reyes looked at the road behind them. Empty. Good.

"Vasquez," he said.

She looked at him.

"What I saw on the road from West Point."

Her expression did not change. She had been waiting for this since he'd said it to Shores, which Shores had apparently been constitutionally incapable of keeping to himself. She settled her weight slightly, the adjustment of someone preparing to receive information and do something with it.

"Day before yesterday," he said. "We were moving south from West Point on the 31. Came through a neighborhood on the east side — residential, single family, the kind with the long driveways." He said it without inflection, the way you gave a report. "There was a man in the road. He'd been there a while. I could tell from the — from the position." He paused. "No visible bite. No injury. He was dressed for mowing the lawn. Gloves, hat. He'd come out to mow his lawn and he'd died in the road."

Vasquez said nothing. Diane had gone still. She was listening.

"He got up while I was watching him," Reyes said. "Took about forty seconds from the time I spotted him. He'd been down when I saw him — I watched him reanimate. Watched the whole thing."

The truck moved through the morning. Hicks breathed.

"I've seen three other cases," Reyes said. "Two of them bite cases, which is what we were told to expect. One of them was a woman in a parking lot on the 9th — she had a cardiac event. I saw it happen. She went down, and eight minutes later she was up."

"Forty seconds," Vasquez said. "The man in the road."

"Forty seconds from first movement to standing. He'd been down longer — I don't know how long."

"Less than a minute," Diane said. Quiet, like she was confirming something she'd been carrying for a while. "That's what I saw at Cortman. And I heard the same from someone in the waiting room on the second — he'd been on shortwave all night. Said it was consistent. Under a minute from the time they went down."

Vasquez looked at her.

"Zero to one minute from death," Diane said. "That's the window." She held Vasquez's eyes. "Which means anybody who dies in this truck—"

"Becomes a problem in this truck," Vasquez said. Flat, factual, the completion of the sentence that needed completing.

Nobody said anything for a moment. The road ran under them, cracked asphalt and the occasional lurch where a season of frost had heaved a section up.

Reyes looked at Hicks.

Diane looked at Hicks.

Vasquez looked at the road behind them.

"He knows," Diane said. Quietly. "I think he's known for a while."

Reyes had thought so too. The particular quality of a man's silence when he has understood something about his situation and is deciding how to hold it. He had seen it before, in other situations, in other people who were at the end of their options and knew it. It looked like stillness. It looked like patience. It was neither.

"We tell Greer," Vasquez said. "About the window."

"He needs to be able to plan around it," Reyes agreed.

"When we stop."

"When we stop."

The truck ran east and the county ran past them on both sides, left in the middle of itself, the sprinklers and the open doors and the patient yellow blink of a hazard light somewhere behind them now, and Hicks breathed his labored breath under the blue tarp and the morning kept heating up.

## III.

The roadblock was not military.

That was the first thing Cutler registered when they came around the long curve on Route 9 and found it — not the block itself, three vehicles arranged across the road in a rough chevron with the deliberateness of people who had thought about it, but the absence of uniforms. Civilian clothes. Four people visible, two more shapes behind the vehicles that might be people or might be shadow, and a hand-painted sign on cardboard propped against the center truck that said STOP.

Cutler stopped.

Gary had his window down before the truck was fully still. Old instinct.

Greer was out of the truck before Gary, because Greer was the kind of man who did not wait to see what other people decided to do first. He came around the hood with his hands visible — not raised, just forward and open, the deliberate posture of someone who had decided what signal to send before he sent it.

The four visible people were watching him with the particular wariness of people who had been wrong about who to trust recently and were building new policy around it. One of them had a shotgun. One had what looked like a deer rifle. The other two had tools — a crowbar, a length of pipe — in the way of people who had improvised.

Gary got out.

Cutler stayed behind the wheel, engine running.

"We're moving through," Greer said. Clear, even, not loud. "We've got wounded in the truck bed and children in the cab. We're not looking for trouble."

"Where you headed," said the one with the shotgun. A woman, Gary registered. Fifties, gray-haired, with the flat eyes of someone who'd been running on no sleep and high stakes for several days. The shotgun was held the way someone held it who knew how.

"East," Greer said.

"How far east."

"Far enough to be out of the county."

A pause. The woman looked at the truck — at the cab, the bed, the configuration of people, counting, assessing. Gary watched her do it. She was good at it.

"Army," she said.

"Yes, ma'am."

"You're the fourth group of Army we've seen in three days. First three kept moving." She paused. "Didn't stop. Didn't say anything."

"I'm stopping," Greer said. "I'm saying something."

She looked at him. Gary looked at her looking at him, at the thing being decided in the space between them, the calculation of whether to trust a twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant who had stopped his truck and was standing in the road with his hands open.

"We've got twenty-three people," she said. "This crossroads, three houses back, the church." She nodded at something behind the block. "Elderly. Kids. Someone with a broken arm we set ourselves because there's nobody else."

"I know," Greer said. Not dismissive. Not promising anything. Just acknowledging the shape of what she was carrying.

"We're not being moved on," she said. "We tried to move. People didn't make it." A pause. "This is where we are."

"Then this is where you are," Greer said. "We're not here to move you."

Gary watched the woman's face. Watched the recalculation. Watched the shotgun's angle shift two degrees toward the ground in the way of something that wasn't a decision yet but was a possibility.

"You got medical," she said. Looking past Greer at the truck, at the shape of the bed. At Diane, who had appeared at the side of the truck and was just standing there. The universal legibility of a nurse.

"Yes," Greer said.

A pause. A long pause.

"The broken arm," Diane said, from the side of the truck. "Can I look at it."

The woman with the shotgun looked at her for a long moment. Then she looked back at Greer. Then back at Diane.

"Yeah," she said. "Alright."

It cost them forty minutes. Diane looked at the arm — a man named Gerald, sixty-one, who had set his own radius fracture on July 7th with the help of his neighbor and a piece of lumber and who was in more pain than he was admitting and whose color was not right. She looked at it and she re-splinted it properly with materials from the kit in Morrow's pack and she gave Gerald two aspirin from the same kit and told him the color was from the initial injury and should resolve and told him what to watch for if it didn't.

She didn't tell him what to do if something happened to him.

Gary stayed by the truck. He watched Greer move through the group of twenty-three people with the particular energy of a man who had been given a task that fit his framework and was executing it without remainder — shaking hands, listening, not making promises he couldn't keep but making the ones he could. He watched Greer crouch down and talk to a child who was maybe nine years old with the focused attention of a man who had time for it.

Morrow came up beside him.

"He's good at this," Gary said.

"Yes," Morrow said.

"You worried about when he can't be."

Morrow was quiet for a moment. "I'm worried about the gap between when he stops being good at it and when he realizes he's stopped."

Gary watched Greer with the child. The child said something. Greer laughed — genuinely, quickly, the way people laughed in July 1993 when something was briefly and unexpectedly funny. Then the laugh was over and they were back in the day.

"We're leaving them," Gary said. Flat. Placing it.

"We can't take twenty-three people to Harlan in an F-150."

"I know that."

"He knows that."

"I know he does." Gary looked at the crossroads, at the hand-painted sign, at the church in the middle distance with its marquee still reading COME IN WE ARE OPEN. "Doesn't mean it's nothing."

"No," Morrow said. "It doesn't mean that."

They left the people at the crossroads with four days of military rations from the pack Greer had split without discussion, two aspirin bottles, Diane's instructions for Gerald, and the frequency for Checkpoint Harlan's radio which Greer had written on the back of the cardboard sign in black marker and handed back to the woman with the shotgun.

She had looked at it for a moment. Then she'd looked at Greer.

"If we get through," he said, "I'll send someone back."

She had not said she believed him. She had not said she didn't. She'd folded the cardboard and put it in her pocket and stepped to the shoulder and watched them drive through the gap they'd made in the chevron.

Jesse watched her in the side mirror as they pulled away. She stood in the road until the truck curved out of sight, the cardboard folded in her pocket and the shotgun at her side.

He watched until she was gone.

"Dad," he said.

"I know," Gary said.

Lily pressed play on the Walkman. This time it was the blank hiss of the end of the tape, running on, running on, and she didn't press stop.
