<p><strong>July 11, 1993 — Checkpoint Harlan, LaRue County, Knox Exclusion Zone</strong></p><p>Gary woke at five-fifteen by the light and did not go back to sleep.</p><p>He lay on the cot for a few minutes listening to the shelter — Diane's breathing, Lily's, Jesse against the wall in the particular stillness that meant he was also awake and also not saying so — and then he got up quietly and went outside.</p><p>The drill field in the early morning was a different place than it had been the night before. Quieter, obviously, but also stiller in a way that wasn't just the absence of noise — the tents sat in the low light like things that had always been here, the canvas damp with dew, the paths between them dark with the night's moisture, and the ordinariness of it was its own kind of unease. Three weeks ago this had been a place where National Guard soldiers did PT in the morning and signed forms in the afternoon and went home on weekends. The grass had been mowed. The flag had been ceremonial. Someone had parked in the lot and driven home for dinner and watched the news and gone to sleep in a house with air conditioning and phone lines that worked. Gary had a sense, standing in it now, of a set of rails that the world had been running on being quietly, finally pulled up — not ripped out, not destroyed, just gone, the ties still there but the steel missing, the train sitting on the bare ground trying to remember what forward meant.</p><p>He found the water station and washed his face — the water cold from the jerry can, the shock of it on his skin the first clean physical sensation he'd had in days — and stood for a moment looking at the armory block.</p><p>The flag was up. The lights were on in the upper windows. Vehicles were moving on the other side of the inner fence — not urgently, just moving, the early operational tempo of an installation that was still functioning but was functioning harder than it was designed to. He watched a Humvee cross the inner yard and disappear around the back of the main building and tried to read from that single data point what the day was going to look like on the military side of the wire.</p><p>He couldn't read enough. The inner fence was a boundary that information did not cross easily, and Gary filed that as a thing he was going to need to solve.</p><p>"You're up early."</p><p>Ruth was at the end of the row with her clipboard and a tin cup of something that steamed in the morning air. She said it without looking up from whatever she was marking.</p><p>"Old habit," Gary said.</p><p>"Contractor?"</p><p>He looked at her. "How."</p><p>"Hands. The way you looked at the fencework when you came in." She made another mark. "My father ran a plumbing operation in Bowling Green for thirty years. I know the look."</p><p>Gary filed that — not the content of it, the fact of it. The specific detail she'd chosen. A woman who introduced herself through what she noticed rather than what she was. "Electrical," he said. "Hardin County."</p><p>She nodded, as if confirming something she'd already suspected. "Your wife's the nurse."</p><p>"Eleven years at Cortman Medical."</p><p>Ruth looked up at that. A brief, specific attention — the clipboard pausing, the pen stopping mid-stroke, the eyes direct and still. "Cortman's gone."</p><p>"I know. She was there on the third."</p><p>Something passed through Ruth's face — not sympathy, exactly, but the recognition of a weight, the way one person who carried things recognized another person's carrying. "They need her at the station. I told her last night — I don't know if she heard me or if it landed."</p><p>"It landed," Gary said. "She'll go."</p><p>Ruth looked at him in the appraising way she looked at everything — not unfriendly, just accurate, the look of a woman who had learned that accuracy was a form of respect. "And you," she said. "What are you going to do with yourself."</p><p>Gary looked at the inner fence. At the armory block. At the flag. "That," he said, "is an excellent question."</p><p>"The military doesn't want civilians in their business," Ruth said, without inflection. "Which is their prerogative. The civilian side wants for practical people more than it wants for anything else right now." She held out the clipboard. "I have a list. Maintenance issues, organizational problems, things that need looking at by someone who knows how things work. It's not glamorous."</p><p>Gary took the clipboard and looked at the list.</p><p>It was three pages long. Written in a hand that was small and precise and organized by category — <em>Water/Sanitation</em>, <em>Structural</em>, <em>Electrical</em>, <em>General</em> — with priority marks in the margin that told him Ruth had been thinking about triage long before she handed the clipboard to someone who could execute it.</p><p>"No," he agreed, "it isn't."</p><p>He handed it back. She made a note. He got the sense, from the efficiency of the gesture, that she had already written him down for something before she handed it to him, and the clipboard had been a formality, and she had correctly judged that he would not object to that.</p><p>He did not object to that.</p><p>"Generator three is running rough," she said. "The Army has their own technician but he's occupied. If you know anyone who's good with engines—"</p><p>"I know someone," Gary said.</p><p>He went to find Cutler.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><p>Diane told herself she was going to the medical station to look, not to commit.</p><p>The distinction felt important enough at seven in the morning that she held onto it until she got there, at which point it stopped being useful.</p><p>The canopy was a twenty-by-thirty-foot canvas structure at the north end of the drill field, open on two sides, with cots arranged in rows and a triage area near the entrance and a supply section in the back that Diane clocked in one sweeping look as inadequate but not catastrophically so — bandages stacked unevenly, medication bottles in a cardboard box without labels facing out, a sharps container that was full and hadn't been replaced. Two men were working — a medic in his thirties with the focused, fatigued quality of someone past the point of asking for help, and a younger man in civilian clothes who moved with enough confidence to suggest medical training without quite enough precision to suggest formal nursing. The vet tech Ruth had mentioned, probably.</p><p>There were eleven occupied cots.</p><p>She stopped at the entrance and the medic looked up.</p><p>She said, "I'm a nurse. Eleven years, ER." She paused. "I'm a civilian. I'm in Sector C."</p><p>The medic looked at her for exactly two seconds. The two seconds contained a complete assessment — her posture, her hands, the way she stood in the entrance of a medical space as if she belonged in it, which she did. "Can you do a wound assessment?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Cot four. Laceration, secondary infection. I cleaned it yesterday but I don't have the right antibiotic and I need to know how much time I have."</p><p>She went to cot four.</p><p>The wound was a six-inch laceration along the left forearm — not a bite, a cut, glass from the look of the edges, the irregular border of a piece that had shattered rather than sliced. Sustained sometime in the last five days and improperly dressed by whoever had dressed it first — the gauze packed too tight, the tape pulling at the skin, the work of someone who had tried and hadn't known. The infection was early-stage, localized, the tissue around it red and warm but not yet tracking. She had time. Not a lot, but some.</p><p>She worked the assessment the way she worked everything — methodically, without performance, her hands doing what eleven years had trained them to do in the specific, considered register of a person who had learned that composure was a clinical instrument and not just a personality trait. The man on the cot was sixty-something, wide-faced, with the resigned patience of someone who had been in enough medical situations to know that cooperation was faster than resistance. His hands were calloused in the way of a man who worked with them and his face had the weathered, open quality of someone who spent most of his time outdoors.</p><p>"How's it look," he said.</p><p>"You have time," she said. "Not infinite time. How's your pain?"</p><p>"I've had worse."</p><p>"That's not a number."</p><p>He almost smiled. "Five."</p><p>"Where are you assigned."</p><p>"Sector B. Frank Briars." He nodded at the canopy entrance. "My wife and daughter are out there. I didn't want to worry them."</p><p>Diane looked at the wound and then at the man and made a note of the name. "Mr. Briars. The infection is manageable if we can get the right medication. I'm going to talk to the medic and see what's available."</p><p>She re-dressed the wound — properly this time, the gauze layered in the pattern she'd been taught at Cortman, the tape placed where it would hold without pulling, the pressure even — and stood and went to find the medic, and the distinction between looking and committing was gone, and she did not particularly mourn it because she had known since she walked in that it was going to go, and the knowing had been enough.</p><p>She worked the station through the morning.</p><p>She did not think about Cortman. She thought about the eleven cots and what was on them and what she knew and what she needed to find out. She thought about Frank Briars' wound and what antibiotic would clear the infection and whether the station had it and if not what the nearest equivalent was. She thought about the medic's supply list and the gap between what was on it and what was in the back, and about the specific problem of a medical station that had been set up for military personnel trying to absorb a civilian population with a much wider range of conditions.</p><p>She did not think about the woman in the hallway at Cortman Medical on July 3rd.</p><p>Not until the station quieted around eleven and she was standing at the supply shelves counting what they had left of wound dressing, and the quiet let something through that the work had been holding back, and the fluorescent hum of the battery-powered lamp on the supply table was the same frequency as the fluorescent hum of the nurses' station at Cortman, and the match was close enough that her hands stopped and her breathing changed and she put both hands on the shelf and stood there for thirty seconds and let it be there and then put it back where she kept it.</p><p>Then she went back to work.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><p>Lily was bored.</p><p>She understood, in the way she understood most things — not in words but in the specific gravity of a situation — that boredom was not something she was supposed to say. The week had been many things and she had been quiet through most of them in the way that was required, in the way that she could feel her parents needing her to be, and she had been good at it because she was good at reading what was needed and providing it. She was seven years old and she was good at this in a way that had something to do with being the youngest and something to do with being Lily specifically and something to do with the week, which had taught her things about what adults needed from children that no week should have to teach.</p><p>But it was morning and her father was gone and her mother was gone and Jesse was sitting against the shelter wall with his eyes doing the thing they did, which meant he was somewhere else and would come back eventually and could not be talked to in the meantime, and there was nothing to do in the shelter and the Walkman tape had run out.</p><p>She put the Walkman carefully in her jacket pocket and went outside.</p><p>Sector C in the morning was people. That was the first thing — there were people everywhere, more people than she had been around in a week, and the sounds they made were the sounds of a lot of people in a small space doing ordinary things — talking, moving, the clank of the water station, a child laughing somewhere that made her head turn — which was different from the sounds of the week and better, mostly, except for the parts that weren't. She stood at the entrance to the shelter row and looked at Harlan and tried to understand its geography the way her father looked at things — systematically, left to right, near to far.</p><p>Tents. People moving between them. A water station. More tents, a different row. Further out: the fence, the armory, the flag. She knew the flag. She had been looking at it since last night. It was the same flag but in the morning light it was a different color and the wind had it and it moved in the way that flags moved, which was the way of a thing that was attached to one place and went everywhere else.</p><p>She went left because left was where the rows went further and further out where there were more tents and maybe something to see.</p><p>The second row was Sector B. A sign said so. She walked it carefully, looking into the open entrance flaps of shelters where people had left them open, cataloguing — a family with a baby, the baby making the small sounds of a baby who was awake but not unhappy. An old man sitting in a folding chair with his eyes closed, his mouth open, his chest rising and falling slowly. Two women talking in the low serious voice of people sharing something important, their heads close together. She did not stop at any of them. She was looking for something she did not have a name for yet.</p><p>At the end of Sector B a girl was sitting on an upturned crate doing nothing.</p><p>Not nothing exactly. She was doing the kind of nothing that had content to it — looking at the middle distance with the particular patience of someone who had exhausted the available options and arrived at stillness not as a choice but as the thing that was left. She was older than Lily, maybe a lot older — a teenager, Lily thought, though the exact number was the kind of thing Lily was not good at guessing — with dark blond hair in a loose braid and the red around the eyes of someone who had cried recently and was done with it for now.</p><p>She looked at Lily.</p><p>Lily looked at her.</p><p>"Hi," the girl said.</p><p>"Hi," Lily said.</p><p>A pause. The girl moved over on the crate without being asked, making room that Lily hadn't requested. Lily looked at the space and then sat down on it anyway.</p><p>"I'm Amy," the girl said.</p><p>"Lily."</p><p>Amy looked at her jacket pocket. At the shape of the Walkman in it. "What is that."</p><p>Lily took it out and showed her. "It's a Walkman. For tapes." She paused. "The tape ran out."</p><p>Amy looked at it in the careful way of someone being respectful of a thing that mattered — not just polite but attentive, the way you looked at something that belonged to someone who had decided to show it to you. "Which tape."</p><p>"Lionel Richie." She paused. "Hello."</p><p>Amy's face did something complicated — a movement that started as recognition and became something else, something that involved the eyes and the mouth and the space between them where feelings went when they were too large for either. "My mom loves that song." She said it in the past tense and then heard herself say it that way and went quiet.</p><p>Lily held the Walkman in her lap. "She's probably fine," she said.</p><p>Amy looked at her. "How do you know."</p><p>Lily thought about this honestly. "I don't," she said. "But I think it anyway. My dad says you can think something without knowing it for sure."</p><p>Amy considered this for a long moment. Then she said, "My mom is in the medical tent. She's fine. She just had to help someone." She paused. "Your mom?"</p><p>"Same," Lily said.</p><p>They sat on the crate together in the morning heat and watched Sector B go about its business, and Lily pressed play on the Walkman even though she knew what would happen, and the blank hiss ran, and she let it, and Amy didn't ask why.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><p>Jesse had been watching the woman with the notebook for twenty minutes before she noticed him.</p><p>She was three rows over — Sector A, nearest the armory fence — sitting cross-legged on a cot that she had dragged to the entrance of her shelter with the deliberate pragmatism of someone who required light and airflow and had decided to reorganize her space accordingly. She had a spiral notebook open on one knee and a pen working steadily, and every so often she would look up at something happening in the field and back down at the notebook and write more. She was not writing about what was in front of her in the way of someone keeping a diary. She was writing the way his English teacher back home wrote on the board — purposefully, like the words were going somewhere specific and the getting-there was work that mattered.</p><p>He was sitting against the outside wall of the Sector C boundary shelter with nowhere to be and the specific restlessness of a person whose instinct was to observe and who had run out of easy vantage points. He had watched Ruth do her morning rounds — the efficient circuit, the clipboard, the stops that were brief and the stops that were longer, the difference between them a language he was beginning to read. He had watched a Humvee cross the inner yard twice. He had watched the man his father called Marcus — no name confirmed, just the shape of him — emerge from a shelter in Sector B and walk the perimeter of the fence for ten minutes with his hands in his pockets and his eyes moving in the systematic way of someone taking inventory.</p><p>Then he had noticed the woman with the notebook.</p><p>She looked up and caught him looking.</p><p>He did not look away, because looking away would mean he had been doing something he shouldn't, and he hadn't been. He held the look the way Reyes held a look — steady, neutral, without apology.</p><p>She held it for a moment, assessing, and then she lifted her chin slightly in the universal acknowledgment of one person recognizing another person's existence, and went back to the notebook.</p><p>Jesse got up and walked over.</p><p>She watched him approach without expression. Up close she was younger than he'd thought from a distance — late twenties maybe, Korean-American, with the kind of stillness that came not from calm but from attention. Her eyes were the eyes of someone who was always reading the room, and the room she was reading was everything.</p><p>"What are you writing," he said.</p><p>"Everything," she said.</p><p>He waited to see if there was more. There wasn't. He looked at the notebook — her hand was over the page, not covering it exactly, just resting there, the pen still between her fingers. "Are you a reporter."</p><p>She looked at him with the reassessing attention. "What makes you think that."</p><p>"The way you look at things before you write them down." He paused. "My dad looks at a building before he works on it. You look at everything like that."</p><p>She considered this. "Lena Park," she said. "Louisville Courier-Journal." She held out her hand and he shook it — her grip firm, specific, the handshake of a person who meant it. "You came in yesterday. The military group."</p><p>"My family," Jesse said. "They were escorting us."</p><p>"Where from."</p><p>"Muldraugh. We've been on the road since the ninth."</p><p>Lena looked at him with the full attention of someone for whom this was significant information — not the significance of gossip but the significance of a data point, a piece of the picture she was assembling in the notebook on her knee. She uncapped the pen. "Can I ask you some things."</p><p>Jesse looked at the notebook. At the pen. At the woman holding them.</p><p>"Yeah," he said.</p><p>He sat down on the ground outside her shelter, back against the frame, and she asked him things and he answered them carefully, in the way his father answered questions — giving what was true and accurate and nothing more than what was asked, which turned out to be its own kind of language that Lena Park spoke fluently. She wrote quickly without looking at the page, the pen moving in the peripheral vision while her eyes stayed on him. She asked good questions, which meant she asked questions that were smaller than they sounded — not <em>what happened in Muldraugh</em> but <em>what time of day did you first hear sirens</em> — and the smallness of them pulled out more than the large ones would have.</p><p>After forty minutes she closed the notebook.</p><p>"You're sixteen," she said.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"You talk like you're older."</p><p>Jesse thought about the week. About what it had been teaching him and how — the curriculum he didn't have a name for, the courses taught by Reyes and Morrow and his father and the road itself. "It's been a long week," he said.</p><p>Lena looked at him for a moment. Something in her face that was not pity — something more considered than that, more respectful, the look of a person who recognized what a week could do to someone and was not going to diminish it by calling it anything other than what it was. "I've been at Harlan since the eighth," she said. "I have information. Some of it I can verify, some of it I can't yet." She paused. "I'm going to need people I can trust with parts of it while I work out what's true." She said it directly, the way Ruth said things — not warming it up, not cooling it down, just the fact of it. "You seem like you might be that."</p><p>Jesse looked at the armory block. At the flag. At the inner fence and the vehicles moving behind it.</p><p>"What kind of information," he said.</p><p>"The kind that makes more sense if you understand what's happening outside the wire," she said. "Which is different from what they're telling people in here."</p><p>The morning heat was coming up. Sector C was busy behind them. Somewhere near the medical canopy, a door opened.</p><p>"Okay," Jesse said.</p><p>Lena Park opened the notebook again.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><p>Gary found Del Norris at the water station in Sector A at half past ten, which was not where he expected to find him — he had been directed to Sector A by Ruth, who had described Del as <em>the angry one from Louisville, you'll know him when you see him</em> — but close enough to count.</p><p>Del was filling two jerry cans simultaneously with the efficient irritation of a man who had been waiting for something to do and had settled for this. He was broad across the shoulders, thick in the neck, with close-cropped gray hair and the permanently lined face of someone who had spent decades in physical work and outdoor weather. His hands were a foreman's hands — scarred across the knuckles, permanently rough, the nails cut short and clean in the way of a man who had given up on keeping them nice and settled for keeping them out of the way. He stood the way men who managed other men stood — planted, square, occupying space as a statement of fact rather than a claim.</p><p>He looked at Gary the way Gary had looked at Morrow on the road — the quick inventory of a man reading another man for type and finding the read inconclusive and reserving judgment.</p><p>"Ruth sent you," Del said.</p><p>"She pointed me in the right direction," Gary said.</p><p>"Same thing." Del lifted the first full jerry can and set it aside with the ease of someone for whom forty pounds was not a number worth counting. "Gary Hutchins. She told me about you."</p><p>"Del Norris."</p><p>"I know." Gary picked up the second jerry can before Del could reach it and carried it to the water station rack. Del watched him do it with the expression of a man recalibrating — not the weight, which was nothing, but the gesture, which was something.</p><p>"Electrical," Del said.</p><p>"Hutchins Electric, Hardin County. You?"</p><p>"Norris Logistics. South Louisville. Warehouse and distribution." He said it in the flat way of men who had spent their careers in unglamorous work and had stopped expecting other people to know what it meant. "We ran product for six manufacturers and two grocery chains. I know what it looks like when a supply chain stops working." He looked at the tent rows, at the water station, at the jerry cans. "I know what it looks like before it stops working."</p><p>Gary looked at him. "And."</p><p>Del looked at the armory block. At the inner fence. At the vehicles Gary had been watching since morning. Then he looked back at Gary with the particular exhausted fury that Gary had clocked in him from twenty feet away — not the fury of a man who was out of control but the fury of a man who had done the arithmetic and did not like what it added up to and was angry that the people who should have been doing the same arithmetic appeared to not be doing it.</p><p>"You want to know what Louisville looks like right now," Del said.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Del set down the second jerry can and leaned against the water station rack with his arms crossed in the posture of a man who had been waiting to say something to someone worth saying it to.</p><p>"I drove in on the fifth," he said. "My mother lives in Muldraugh. I was trying to get to her before the roads closed — I saw the news on the third and fourth and I didn't like what I was seeing, so I got in the car." He paused. "I didn't make it. They closed the highway at the interchange at four in the morning on the sixth. I had maybe forty minutes before the perimeter was hard."</p><p>"And outside the perimeter," Gary said.</p><p>"I sat at the roadblock for six hours on the sixth." Del's jaw worked. "Watching." The word carried the weight of a man who had spent six hours watching something he couldn't do anything about and had spent the five days since carrying the watching. "Louisville doesn't know. That's the first thing. The news is saying quarantine, biological hazard, Army's handling it. People are scared but they're going to work. The grocery stores are getting crowded, people are buying canned goods, but it's not—" He stopped. "It's not what's happening inside."</p><p>Gary thought about Janet in Memphis who thought Tommy Hicks was working and was fine. He thought about the version of July 1993 that existed on the other side of the perimeter — a version where the phones worked and the television said things that sounded true and people went to bed believing them — and how much of it was still intact and how long the intact part could hold.</p><p>"The blockade soldiers," Gary said. "What are they saying?"</p><p>"To the public? Nothing. Standard issue — area restricted, move along, no unauthorized personnel." Del's eyes went to the armory block again. "But I talked to a private on the fourth hour. Kid couldn't have been older than Kenny Shores. He was scared. He told me—" Del stopped. Recalibrated. The recalibration was visible — the jaw tightening, the eyes narrowing, the man deciding which version of the next sentence to give and choosing the direct one. "He told me the orders were indefinite containment. Not temporary quarantine. Indefinite."</p><p>Gary let that settle.</p><p>"He told me they'd had three soldiers try to come out the previous night," Del said. "Over the wire. To their families." He said it without editorializing. Just the shape of it — three men who had families on the other side and a wire in between and the specific kind of desperation that made a man go over a wire. "The orders on those soldiers were the same as the orders on civilians trying to go the other direction."</p><p>The heat was full up now, pressing down from overhead and rising from the asphalt. From the medical canopy at the far end of the field came the sound of something being moved — equipment, furniture — and a voice giving instructions.</p><p>"They're not going to open this perimeter," Gary said.</p><p>"No," Del said. "They're not." He picked up the first jerry can and looked at Gary steadily, the full weight of five days of watching and arithmetic and the particular fury that came from knowing something and being unable to make anyone else know it fast enough. "Which means whatever happens next happens inside this wire. And whoever's making decisions inside this wire better be making them with that in mind." He paused. "I've been here four days. I have not seen evidence that the people making decisions inside this wire are making them with that in mind."</p><p>Gary looked at the flag on the armory pole. At the upper windows where the lights had been on since five. At the Humvee crossing the inner yard for the third time this morning.</p><p>"Tell me more about what you saw at the roadblock," he said.</p><p>Del set the jerry can down again.</p><p>He talked for another thirty minutes.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p><p>Vasquez found Diane at the medical station at half past two, which was where Vasquez had been told she would be and where she had expected to find her.</p><p>She stood at the entrance to the canopy and watched Diane work for a moment before she announced herself — not surveillance, just the assessment of a person who had learned to understand other people by watching them do the things they knew how to do. Diane was at a cot near the back of the station, changing a dressing on an elderly woman's leg with the methodical, unhurried competence of someone for whom this was reflex. She talked to the woman while she worked, low, steady — not performing reassurance, just being present in the way that was its own kind of medicine, the voice that said <em>I see you and you are being taken care of</em> without saying either of those things.</p><p>Vasquez had seen that quality in good NCOs. She had not expected to find it in a civilian nurse from Muldraugh, and finding it did not surprise her, which meant she had already known it was there.</p><p>"Sergeant Vasquez," the medic said, from across the canopy. Flagging her as military, tracking her presence. Vasquez understood this — the station was civilian space and she was in uniform.</p><p>"I'm not here in any official capacity," Vasquez said, clearly enough for Diane to hear. "I'm here to see Mrs. Hutchins."</p><p>Diane had looked up. She finished the corner of the dressing she was on before she stood, which was the right sequence, and came to the entrance.</p><p>"You look tired," Vasquez said.</p><p>"You look the same as yesterday," Diane said.</p><p>"I always look like this."</p><p>"I know," Diane said. "I was being polite."</p><p>Something in Vasquez's face moved in a direction that was almost a smile. She tilted her head toward the field — <em>outside</em> — and Diane followed her to a spot twenty yards from the canopy entrance where they could talk without being in anyone's way.</p><p>"How is the station," Vasquez said.</p><p>"Understaffed and under-supplied. There's a wound infection that needs the right antibiotic and I'm not sure they have it. The medic is good — Sgt. Hale — he's been running on fumes since the eighth." She paused. "How is the armory side."</p><p>Vasquez was quiet for a moment in the way she was quiet when she was deciding what to give — not secrecy but calibration, the sorting of information into what was useful and what was only alarming.</p><p>"The CO is making plans," she said. "That's what I can tell you." She paused. "The plans are not final. They change every few hours based on what's coming in from the perimeter."</p><p>"What's coming in from the perimeter."</p><p>Another pause. Shorter this time. "More pressure than they'd anticipated. The dead move. The zone isn't static."</p><p>Diane looked at her steadily. "Elena."</p><p>Vasquez looked back. It was the first time Diane had used her given name and they both registered it — the shift from the formal to the personal, the crossing of a line that had been there since the logging road and was now, by mutual decision, not.</p><p>"The command is working with information that's four days old in some places and current in others," Vasquez said carefully. "Lieutenant Greer is in meetings that I'm not in. What I can tell you is that the people I trust inside this installation are working very hard, and the question of how long very hard is sufficient is one I'm watching."</p><p>Diane took that in the way she took most things — without visible reaction, sorting it in the clinical part of her mind that processed information and separated what was actionable from what wasn't.</p><p>"Morrow," Diane said.</p><p>"Stable," Vasquez said. "No change. No fever." She paused. "Greer is managing the reporting question carefully."</p><p>"Carefully."</p><p>"He hasn't lied to anyone," Vasquez said. "He's managing what's in the record and what isn't. There's a difference."</p><p>"I know the difference," Diane said.</p><p>They stood in the afternoon heat. From the tent rows came the ordinary sounds of the civilian block settling into its second day — children, conversation, the water station running. From inside the inner fence, the Humvee that Gary had been watching since morning.</p><p>"I wanted to check on you," Vasquez said. Not an addendum. The thing she'd actually come for.</p><p>Diane looked at her. "Why."</p><p>Vasquez considered the question with the seriousness it deserved. "You were the first person in that group who was honest with me," she said. "The porch conversation. You said what you knew and what you didn't and you didn't dress either one up." She paused. "That's not common." Another pause. "I find myself wanting to make sure that's still there."</p><p>Diane looked at the canopy. At the eleven cots, the supply shelves, the medic moving between patients. At the work that had absorbed her since morning and the thing it had been holding back and the thirty seconds at the supply shelf where it hadn't.</p><p>"It's still there," she said.</p><p>Vasquez nodded. Once, the way she nodded when something was confirmed rather than when something was acknowledged — the distinction small but real, the nod of a woman who kept track of the difference.</p><p>"Good," she said. She looked at the field, the rows, the armory block. At the whole machinery of Harlan doing what it was doing. "I'm in Barracks B if you need to find me. Any time." She said it without ceremony, the way she said most things. "I mean any time."</p><p>Diane heard the weight in the qualifier. "Elena."</p><p>Vasquez looked at her.</p><p>"Thank you," Diane said.</p><p>Vasquez held the look for a moment. Then she turned and walked back toward the inner gate, steady and unhurried, the way she always moved — not slow, just deliberate, each step placed with the same precision she placed her words — and Diane watched her go and then went back to the medical station and back to work.</p><p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>
