## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46 | **Pre-collapse:** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

Big man gone thick through the middle. Broad shoulders, rough hands, short graying hair. Work boots and jeans every day like a uniform. Two years Army Reserve in his early twenties. Built his business from a truck and a license.

**Traits:** Patient, deliberate, reads rooms before entering them. Thinks in arithmetic — resources, risk, time. Leads by competence, not charisma. Quiet preparer since 1987, not from ideology but from a practical man's distrust of what the world was telling him. Protective without being performative about it. Running a mental tab of everything he owes and everyone he's failed to help.

**Strengths:** Calm under pressure. Practical intelligence. Earns trust from military and civilian alike by being visibly competent. Makes hard calls and lives with them.

**Flaws:** Carries weight silently until it bends him. Struggles with loss of control — needs to be the decision-maker, and environments where he has no standing cost him. Can become rigid when the arithmetic says one thing and the human cost says another.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Stopped the group at a gas station on a county road north/east of Harlan, night of July 14. Killed his first infected — Dale, the gas station owner, with a tire iron. Two swings. The first wrong, the second final. Dragged the body into the bathroom and closed the door before bringing the group inside. Jesse saw him come out with the iron and understood; neither spoke about it. This is a threshold moment — the knowing became doing, and the cost is in his hands. Admitted "I don't know" to Diane about destination — the first time since July 4th. Named east as the direction: rural, small towns, the most time before the worst catches up. Not a destination — a logic. Leading again, the tab longer than ever. Vasquez and Morrow still unaccounted for. The group of nine is his responsibility.

---

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38 | **Pre-collapse:** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

Compact, dark hair in a practical knot, sharp brown eyes. Moves without waste.

**Traits:** Assesses before she engages. Clinical precision applied to everything — emotions included, which is both a strength and a wall. Uses work as a coping mechanism; the discipline of nursing is the wall between functioning and falling apart. Says what she means without softening it. Watches people the way she watches patients — for what they do, not what they say.

**Strengths:** Medical expertise is the group's most critical asset. Reads people with diagnostic accuracy. Emotionally steady in crisis. Carries more knowledge about the outbreak's mechanism than almost anyone in the civilian population.

**Flaws:** The wall between function and feeling is load-bearing. What she saw at Cortman on July 3rd is still in her. That weight doesn't leave.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Group medic, fully operational. Examined Del at the gas station — ribs 7 and 8 broken, possible hairline on 9, no pneumothorax. Wrapped his ribs, gave him the limits: no lifting, no twisting, six weeks minimum. Moved through the group with the diagnostic eye — assessed everyone without announcing it. Sat with Amy briefly; didn't ask if she was okay, told her "you're here, we're here, tomorrow is tomorrow." Had the private moment with Gary — the "where do we go" conversation. Received "I don't know" and accepted it. East. The wall between function and feeling is still load-bearing and she's still working, which is how she holds it up. Vasquez didn't make the departure; the friendship is established but separated.

---

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16

His father's height, still lean, dark hair worn a little long. A face learning to close. Dark circles.

**Traits:** Observant beyond his years and getting more so by the day. Builds a curriculum from the people around him — watches soldiers for threat assessment, studies his father for decision-making, learns from journalists how to hold information and shape it. Transparent by nature, learning opacity out of necessity. Processes internally before speaking. When he speaks, it's precise.

**Strengths:** Adaptive intelligence. Reads emotional states accurately. Growing ability to function through fear. The intellectual framework he's building is becoming operational — not just observation but action.

**Flaws:** Sixteen. Still forming. The intellectual framework can become a substitute for feeling — he analyzes when he should grieve. The weight of what he processes daily is accumulating faster than his ability to metabolize it.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Running on fumes. Two days of maximum output — the July 4th recount to Lena, carrying Lily through the escape, getting Amy moving, going back for Del, and now this. Saw Gary come out of the gas station with the tire iron and understood what had happened inside. Neither spoke. The curriculum now includes watching his father cross a line. Working the intelligence relay with Lena — heard the shortwave reports of the collapse (perimeter breach, Louisville evacuating, outbreaks outside the zone) and carried it to Gary. Learning calibration from Lena: "your dad gets all of it, the rest we calibrate." Amy is in his orbit; the thread remains primed but unstarted.

---

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7

Small for her age, her mother's dark eyes, her father's jaw when she sets it. Hair in two braids. Carries a yellow Sony Walkman.

**Traits:** Pays more attention than anyone wants her to. Quiet, watchful, processes through observation and physical objects rather than language. The Walkman is her anchor — not the music but the act of pressing play, the ritual of it. Brave in the way children are brave when they don't know the alternative. Finds connections the adults don't engineer.

**Strengths:** Emotional barometer for the group. Doesn't freeze. Doesn't perform distress for attention.

**Flaws:** Seven. Processing a world-ending event through a seven-year-old's framework, which means the feelings arrive without the language to hold them.

> **⚠️ Status**
> The tremor from the Harlan escape stopped during the drive — whether temporary resolution or pause is unclear. At the gas station, went to Amy on her own initiative — no one told her to. Sat beside her. Put the headphones on, pressed play on the blank tape, placed one headphone pad against Amy's knee. The hiss shared between them. This is the closing image of the Harlan Arc: two girls in the dark, the sound of nothing playing. The Walkman ritual has expanded from self-soothing to connection — Lily is doing for Amy what the tape does for her. Anchor for Amy is now active, not potential.

## 🏚️ Harlan Civilians — Traveling with the Family

---

### Del Norris
**Age:** Mid-50s | **Background:** Warehouse foreman, south Louisville

Broad shoulders, foreman's hands, close-cropped gray hair. A particular exhausted fury — past panic, into something colder and more useful.

**Traits:** Practical, direct, says what he's seen without embellishment. The kind of man who drives into a disaster zone to check on his mother and then watches a blockade for six hours because leaving without answers isn't in his wiring. Anger is his fuel, but it's productive anger — pointed, not scattered.

**Strengths:** Physical toughness. Reliable under pressure. Acts on instinct when someone needs protecting, regardless of the cost to himself.

**Flaws:** Fifty-five and burning fuel he doesn't have. Mother in Vine Grove — inside the zone, unaccounted for.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Diagnosed by Diane at the gas station: ribs 7 and 8 broken, possible hairline on 9. No flail segment, no pneumothorax. Wrapped. Can walk, ride, talk. Cannot lift, twist, fight, or take a deep breath without paying for it. Six weeks minimum recovery — the foreman who saved Amy by holding her now needs help getting out of the truck. The injury inverts his role and changes his physicality for the foreseeable future. Accepted Diane's orders with his particular exhausted fury. The Amy/Del thread is planted — he broke his ribs holding her, said the words her parents would have said. That foundation accrues. His mother in Vine Grove remains unresolved.

---

### Ruth
**Age:** Late 50s | **Background:** Father ran a plumbing operation in Bowling Green. Something in her past explains her — not yet revealed.

**Traits:** Practical, unsentimental, past the point of softening things. Tells people what they need to know before they ask. Manages what people are *ready for*, not just what they know. Reads situations two steps ahead of the need. Doesn't perform authority; just has it.

**Strengths:** Organizational intelligence. Social reading. The kind of person who is already packed before anyone announces they're leaving.

**Flaws:** Backstory is unrevealed, which means her motivations are partially opaque. Unsentimental can shade into cold when warmth is what people need.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Skills translating to the road. No clipboard — organizing by hand and memory. Inventoried the group's supplies at the gas station: fourteen cans, six water jugs, two blankets, medical kit, plus whatever's left on the shelves. Held the flashlight for Diane's examination of Del — practical, no commentary. Sat with Lily while Jesse went to the back room for the shortwave. Foil for Gary continues: she organizes from within, he leads from the front. Her backstory remains unrevealed.

---

### Lena Park
**Age:** Late 20s | **Background:** Reporter, Louisville Courier-Journal. Korean-American. Trapped inside the zone while covering the "flu story."

Still, attentive, reads every room. Carries a notebook and a portable shortwave radio.

**Traits:** Asks questions smaller than they sound. Calibrates what to tell people and in what order. Believes someone will eventually need to know what happened here and is making sure the record exists. The notebook is not just journalism — it's an act of faith that the future will care.

**Strengths:** Intelligence gathering and synthesis. Connects patterns others miss. The shortwave gives the group access to information no one else inside the zone has.

**Flaws:** The journalist's instinct to record and calibrate can conflict with the human need to just be present. More information isn't always better when people are at capacity.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Set up the shortwave at the gas station and pulled in the collapse: degrading military frequencies (perimeter sections non-recoverable, units consolidating north), a ham operator in Shepherdsville reporting refugees flooding north on I-65 and sick people outside the zone, and a woman in Lexington aggregating reports statewide ("you are not alone, this is a civil emergency, help each other"). The world outside the zone is starting to sound like the world inside it. Confirmed the aerial strain pattern — people sick without bites. Notebook still closed since the escape. The intelligence relay with Jesse continues; she's teaching him calibration: who gets what information and when. Her record remains the only comprehensive account.

---

### Amy Briars
**Age:** 16

Dark blond hair in a loose braid. Patient, available in the way of someone who has exhausted the options and arrived at stillness.

**Traits:** Quiet, receptive, capable of sitting with discomfort without performing it. Understands that presence is enough. The kind of person who shares silence rather than filling it.

**Strengths:** Emotional availability. Connects with people through being rather than doing.

**Flaws:** What she becomes under grief is unwritten.

> **⚠️ Status**
> In shock. At the gas station: against the wall, knees up, head down, making the sound of nothing. Diane sat with her briefly — told her "you're here, we're here, tomorrow is tomorrow." Amy registered it physically (one deeper breath) but couldn't respond. Lily came to her unprompted, sat beside her, pressed play on the blank Walkman, placed one headphone pad against Amy's knee. Amy's shoulders loosened a fraction. The structure she'd built around herself held but shifted. The grief has not arrived — she's in the space between the event and the understanding of the event. The breakdown will come later, triggered by something small. The pulling-together-after is the real arc. Lily is her anchor. The Jesse thread remains primed. The Del thread is planted.

---

### Marcus
**Age:** Mid-30s | **Background:** Louisville criminal underground, vehicle theft specialty. Alone.

Alert stillness. Eyes that move systematically. Never wastes a position.

**Traits:** Vague about his past, specific about what he's seen. Professional — applies criminal tradecraft (vehicle assessment, situational reading, exit planning) with the precision of someone who survived by being smarter than his environment. Does not perform loyalty; demonstrates it through action.

**Strengths:** Vehicle skills, situational awareness, exit strategy thinking. Sees collapse coming before others because he's spent his life reading when situations turn.

**Flaws:** Trust is transactional by training. His history means the group will always be slightly uncertain about him until he's been tested repeatedly.

> **⚠️ Status**
> The group's security perimeter. At the gas station: circuited the building, lot, and tree line within three minutes of arrival. Positioned on the Suburban's hood watching the road — the systematic scan running on the same frequency it always runs on. Held convoy interval on the drive north — fifty yards, disciplined. The compact with Gary is tested and held. First real group integration still pending — he's settled as useful but his relationship to anyone other than Gary is undeveloped. The complication may still be ahead.

## 🪖 Military — Status Pending

---

### Sergeant First Class Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 34 | **MOS:** 11B Infantryman, senior NCO | Fifteen years in the Army

Compact, direct, dark hair pulled tight, brown eyes that move constantly. Small scar on her right knuckles. Does not fill silence.

**Traits:** Clearest thinker in the group. Watches everything, announces nothing. Makes decisions before she announces them; by the time she says something, she's already committed. The kind of person who carries things she hasn't said yet and you don't notice until she's gone. Loyalty runs to people, not structure, which is rare in a career NCO.

**Strengths:** Tactical intelligence. Reads institutional failure with precision. Invaluable because her loyalty is earned, not automatic.

**Flaws:** Fifteen years of institutional loyalty don't dissolve cleanly. Crossing lines costs something internal that hasn't been examined yet.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Did not make the Harlan departure with the family. Built the friendship with Diane through actions — first name basis, medication for Frank Briars, the consolidation warning (Ch. 10). Named "consolidation" before it happened. Was expected to join but the escape moved fast and she wasn't at the staging area. Planned for POV thread in Ch. 13 showing the collapse from the military side. May merge with Morrow's squad before or during departure. Will converge with the family on the road. The fifteen years of institutional loyalty are dissolving in real time.

---

### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 32 | **MOS:** 11B Infantryman | Born Dothan, Alabama

Six foot even, going leaner than he used to be. Dark hair cut close, lined around the eyes from too much sun over too many years. Moves with deliberate economy. Left sleeve rolled down and buttoned regardless of the heat.

**Traits:** Structure is water to him — he needs it the way some people need certainty. Enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available. Good at soldiering, better at people. Reads his men the way Gary reads rooms. Has a daughter in Georgia he hasn't called since July 1st.

**Strengths:** Leadership through earned trust. Holds a squad together through institutional collapse. Knows when to follow and when to lead. The Morrow/Gary dynamic is the story's core civilian-military relationship.

**Flaws:** Institutional loyalty runs deep. Carries loss quietly; the daughter in Georgia is a constant background frequency.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan at the time of the family's departure. The consolidation would have dissolved his squad and reassigned his remaining people (Reyes, Cutler, Webb) under a new commander. Planned to make his own decision to leave, taking his squad. Convergence with the family on the road — Ch. 13–14. Shores walked toward Elizabethtown during the consolidation; Morrow understands why. His POV thread in Ch. 13 will show the military side of the collapse and the decision to break from command.

---

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29 | **MOS:** 11B, designated marksman | Two deployments — Panama '89, brief assignment '91

Lean, dark, close-cropped black hair, eyes that don't settle. Scar on left jaw, unexplained. Almost always at the periphery.

**Traits:** Thinks in sequences, stripped of sentiment. Watches tree lines. Carries information until it has operational value, then delivers it without editorializing.

**Strengths:** Best shooter in the group. Calm under threat. Provides the security perimeter others rely on without being asked.

**Flaws:** The periphery is also where you go to avoid connection. Whatever he saw coming down from West Point is still unspoken.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan. Part of Morrow's remaining squad. Disclosed the forty-second reanimation window to Vasquez and Diane on the road (Ch. 5) — had been carrying it since July 8th. Jesse has been studying him since Ch. 1 as part of the curriculum. Will travel with Morrow when he makes the decision to leave.

---

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26 | **MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

Stocky, hands always dirty, sweats constantly. Wipes palms on thighs before touching anything mechanical.

**Traits:** Mechanical genius, not ideological about service. Does the job. Pragmatic, reliable, low-drama.

**Strengths:** The group's mechanic. Essential when vehicles are the story.

**Flaws:** Not a leader, not a talker.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan. Part of Morrow's remaining squad. Built the shorthand with Gary on the road — two practical men who established competence and stopped performing around it. Found the F-150 in a clearing with Webb — whatever happened there is unspoken. Looked at Generator Three for Ruth in Ch. 7. Relevance increases when vehicles need maintenance — which is now.

---

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19 | **MOS:** 11B

Tall, angular, long neck. Still growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, stands half a step behind whoever is nearest. Arrived at Fort Knox forty-eight hours before the phones went dead.

**Traits:** First posting. Carries something from the field that he doesn't have language for.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan. Part of Morrow's remaining squad. Was with Cutler in the clearing where the F-150 was found. The half-second vacancy Jesse identified has not resolved. Whether it does or doesn't is still open. Minor character — track but don't invest heavily.

---

### Private First Class Owen Briggs
**Age:** 20 | **MOS:** 11B

Medium height, fair-skinned, blond. A vacancy behind the eyes.

**Traits:** Carries weight he hasn't spoken about. The vacancy is visible to anyone paying attention.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan. Background character. No longer actively tracked. Was present for both deaths of Greer's missing soldiers — handled the immediate situation with Pawlowski before Greer finished it. Has not spoken of it. His weight exists in the story through Greer's telling in Ch. 9.

---

## 🪖 Military — Separated / Independent

---

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20 | **MOS:** 11B | From Elizabethtown, Kentucky — twenty minutes outside the zone

Sandy-haired, freckled, open face. Looks younger than twenty. Always doing something small with his hands.

**Traits:** Eight months enlisted. First posting. The youngest and most transparent member of the military group. Easy, uninvited sociability. Mother and younger brother inside the exclusion zone.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Gone. Was supposed to visit his mother for her birthday July 12th. That date passed. He told no one. When the consolidation order came and the military stripped the western guard posts to reinforce the south, Shores walked into the gap — west, toward Elizabethtown and his mother's house. Not dramatic desertion; he just went. Morrow understands why. Planned for potential return later in the story, changed by whatever he found or didn't find. Separate thread, revisited when the story is ready.

---

### First Lieutenant Paul Greer
**Age:** 27 | **MOS:** 11A Infantry Officer | ROTC, Ohio State. Eagle Scout. Commissioned 1989.

Medium height, lean, upright bearing. Brown hair, regulation cut, clean-shaven. Face still young enough to be readable.

**Traits:** Institutionalist. The mission, the orders, the chain. Eagle Scout earnestness is real but so is the pull of structure. Working hard to be the kind of officer who means it when he says "we are not leaving people."

**Strengths:** Competent. Fast tactical assessment. Genuine conviction about protecting civilians.

**Flaws:** The institution is the lens he sees through. When the institution makes decisions he wouldn't have made independently, the lens wins.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan, part of the command structure. The road Greer and the Harlan Greer are different men — not because he changed but because the institution absorbed him back. The road equality with Gary is gone; inside the wire, rank and role separate them completely. The jeep pass in Ch. 10 — one second of eye contact, the ghost of the road — was the last interaction on page. Stayed with the institution during the consolidation. Took accountability for Mitchell and Pawlowski in Ch. 9 without performing it. His trajectory follows command, wherever that consolidates to. May resurface.

---

### Specialist Darnell Cross
**Age:** 23 | **MOS:** 11B

Broad-shouldered, unhurried. Checks bootlaces before moving — left one first.

**Traits:** Steady. Background presence.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Part of Greer's unit. Stayed with institutional structure. Not actively tracked.

---

## 💀 Deceased

---

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21 | **MOS:** 11B

Died of illness in the truck bed, morning of July 10th. Greer handled the situation personally. Logged at Harlan — a form, a separate board, two sentences.

Had a girlfriend named Janet in Memphis who does not know.

---

### Frank & Carol Briars
**Ages:** Frank early 60s, Carol late 40s | Farmers, rural stretch between West Point and the zone's eastern edge

Did not make it out of Harlan. Frank's arm wound slowed him. Carol wouldn't leave him. They are not confirmed dead on page — they fell behind, the gap widened, and the sound in the gap was enough.
