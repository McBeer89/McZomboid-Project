⚠️ **BUILD 42 SERVER INFO & GUIDELINES**

Current Branch: Unstable
Access: Whitelisted Only

***DISCLAIMER: This server is Whitelisted. Due to the unstable nature of Build 42 and the need for Roleplay rule enforcement, we are keeping the player base controlled.

Play at your own risk: Admins are not responsible for instability, bugs, loss of progress or anything else. A lot of this comes with the nature of development. We have things in place like the Skill Journal to help mitigate these things. We feel the frustration when it happens but we do not have the time or ability to help with every case.***

🛠️ **MODS & INSTALLATION**
Collection Link: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3629098822>

Please Subscribe and Activate these before joining. Also joining the server should automate the process for you.

Note: Skill journal is the main mod we want. Bug fix mods and mods that round out missing features may be used.

🎭 **ROLEPLAY (RP) GUIDELINES**

Narrative: There is no forced story. Players and Factions will shape the history and future of the world organically.

Events: Admins will act as "Dungeon Masters" for occasional live scenes and events.

Meta-Gaming: Please avoid meta-gaming.

Non-RPers: You are welcome to play! You must still submit a basic character bio. Follow OOC rules and strictly inform players in-game that you are not roleplaying.

💀 **DEATH PROTOCOL**
Death is a choice.

Continuing: If you aren't ready to let go, remake your character using the exact same build. Respawn at your safehouse and use the Skill Journal. Do not exploit the journal.

Perma-Death: If you want your character to stay dead, roll a new character and ask an Admin to update the whitelist.

🏠** SAFEHOUSE SETTINGS**

🔓 **ACCESS & TRESPASSING**

Trespassing: Allowed.

Why? To make Roleplay easier (visiting friends/meetings) without needing constant invites.

Theft: Disabled. While people can walk in, they mechanically cannot take items from your claimed safehouse containers.

📍 **CLAIMING ZONES**

Non-Residential: Allowed.

We have enabled "Claim Anywhere" so you can base in unique locations that the game usually forbids (warehouses, shops, etc.).

⚠️ **IMPORTANT RULE: DO NOT CLAIM LOOT HUBS**
Do not claim buildings specific to high-value loot.

🚫 Gun Stores / Police Stations

🚫 Medical Centers / Pharmacies

🚫 Hardware / Tool Stores

Why? These resources are vital. If you claim the building, the loot stops respawning for everyone else.

⏳ **SERVER WIPES & RESETS**

Goal: We aim for a long-standing server with deep player lore. We want the world to survive for "years" in-game and will avoid wipes whenever possible.

Updates & Branch Changes

Community Vote: If the server has been stable for a long time, we will consult the players before upgrading versions.

Emergency Updates: We will only force an upgrade without a vote if it fixes game-breaking bugs.

If a reset is unavoidable, we will attempt to preserve: Characters, Vehicles, Safehouses, Livestock

Disclaimer: Due to the nature of the Unstable Branch, we cannot guarantee that data transfers will be successful. We will try our best.
