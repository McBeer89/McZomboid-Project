## ⚠️ Build 42 — Unstable Branch

The server runs on the **Unstable Branch** of Project Zomboid. Admins are not responsible for bugs, crashes, or lost progress — that comes with the territory on a development build. We have the **Skill Journal** mod in place to soften the blow, but play knowing the risks going in and you'll be fine.

---

## 🛠️ Mods & Installation

Subscribe to the mod collection via the **[Steam Workshop link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3629098822)** before joining. The server will also handle it automatically on connection.

The main mod is the **Skill Journal** — it lets you record and restore your character's skills if progress is lost. Additional mods cover bug fixes and features missing from Build 42.

| **Meta-Gaming** | Please avoid using out-of-character knowledge in-game |
| **Non-Roleplayers** | Welcome — just let people know in-game that you're not RPing |

---

## 💀 Death

**Death is a choice.** You decide what happens to your character.

- **Continuing:** Remake your character with the exact same build, respawn at your safehouse, and restore skills with the Skill Journal. Don't exploit the journal.
- **Perma-death:** Roll a new character and ask an admin to update your whitelist entry.

## ⏳ Server Wipes & Resets

Our goal is a long-running world with deep player history. **Wipes are avoided whenever possible.**

- **Version upgrades** go to a community vote after a long period of stability
- **Emergency upgrades** are forced only if an update fixes game-breaking bugs
- If a reset is unavoidable, we'll attempt to preserve characters, vehicles, safehouses, and livestock — though the Unstable Branch means no guarantees

---

## ⚙️ Migrating Zombies Mod

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Lone Zombie Migration | Every 6–12 hours |
| Horde Migration | Every 48–96 hours |
| Virtual Stop | Off — zombies can wander out of loaded chunks entirely |
| Homing / Fleeing | Not enabled |

> Don't assume a horde is gone permanently — they can and will come back.
