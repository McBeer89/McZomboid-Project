# Zomboid Server Rules

## 1. Respect & Community First
Be kind and respectful to your fellow players. We are here to build a positive, collaborative community, not a toxic one. Do not resort to aggressive language, harassment, or personal attacks when interacting with others. Let's work together to keep the negativity out and focus on the fun of the game and the stories we are creating. Seriously, we mean this one.

---

## 2. Theft & Robbery (Interaction Required)
We want to encourage interaction, even if it is hostile. We are Survivors, not invisible ghosts.

### A. No "Ghost Theft" (Sneaky Stealing)
You are not permitted to steal items or vehicles from another player without interacting with them first.

- **The "Ghosting" Ban**: You cannot sneak up behind a player while they are fishing/looting, take things from their backpack/trunk, and run away without them noticing.
- **Vehicles**: You cannot hotwire and steal a player's vehicle while they are nearby unless you have initiated a hostile takeover (Robbery).

### B. Robbery Protocol (The Highwayman Rule)
If you want something another player has, you must Roleplay the theft.

- **Reveal Yourself**: You must make yourself Visually and Verbally apparent. You cannot rob someone via text chat while hiding in a bush 50 meters away. Nor should you be using the game’s camera mechanics to attack from above before a fight has begun.
- **Initiate**: You must issue a clear demand (e.g., *"Hands up, drop the bag!"* or *"Step away from the car!"*).

### C. The Consequence of Choice (Compliance vs. PvP)
Once a robbery is initiated, the victim's reaction determines the outcome.

#### Compliance (The "Fair Mugging" Limit)
If the victim complies (hands up, stops moving), you cannot kill them. Furthermore, because we want the victim to survive the journey home, you are limited in what you can take:

- **The "Fighting Chance" Clause**: You must leave the victim with the bare minimum to survive. You cannot take their last melee weapon, their last bandage, food, or water bottle, strip them of their clothes, or their backpack (you probably already have one).

- **Loot OR Ride (Choose One)**: You cannot leave a player stranded and empty-handed. You must choose to take *EITHER*:
  - **The Gear**: Their backpack/weapons/items. (They keep their Vehicle).
  - **The Vehicle**: You take the car keys/car. (They keep their Backpack/Gear).
  
  You cannot take both.

#### Resistance or Flight (PvP Authorized)
If the victim chooses to Resist (draws a weapon, refuses demands) or Flee (runs away, drives off), they have consented to PvP.

- **The Risk**: By refusing to comply, the victim waives the "Mugger's Limit" protections. If they fight/run and lose, the aggressor is entitled to loot them fully (within their inventory space).

- **The 5-Second Rule**: Once it is clear that PvP is going to begin via resisting with a verbal agreement to PvP (it can be OOC), a 5-second grace period must be observed. This allows all parties to create distance, equip weapons, and prepare for the scene to unfold before any damage is dealt. 

  - **HOWEVER**, if the defender chooses to flee without roleplay the 5-second rule is null/voided and you risk being shot in the back; if they're a bad shot you very well could survive. 

  - If the defender begins aggressively approaching the attacker without roleplay, or begins shooting without roleplay this will be considered "Fail RP", the attacker is permitted to defend themselves. This goes for the defender as well — if the attacker attacks without roleplay first, they may freely defend themselves; the attacker approaching the defender to initiate roleplay does not count as aggression.

### D. Borrowing & Trading
Before resorting to violence, try communication. Many survivors will trade food for ammo or give you a ride if you just ask.

It’s always worth using Steam’s built-in recording, or screenshots to record these moments, just in case.

---

## 3. Safehouse Wars (Raiding Protocol)
We use the "Claim War" mechanic to simulate breaching defenses. Abuse of this to grief will result in a ban.

### A. Conditions for a Valid Raid (Online Presence Required)
Raiding is a serious event and can only be initiated when the defending party is present and able to respond. Offline raiding is strictly forbidden.

- **Solo Players**: A solo player's base may only be raided when that player is online.
- **Factions (2+ Members)**: A faction's base may only be raided when a majority (over 50%) of their active members are online and present at the base location.

> **The Logic**: This ensures a fair fight and prevents a single defender from having to fight off an entire raiding party alone.

### B. Initiation & Acceptance
- **RP First**: You cannot simply click "Claim War." You must initiate hostile RP, which includes visually and verbally making yourself known and your intentions clear and allowing the defenders 2 minutes to consider options and react via roleplay.
- **The Defender's Duty**: If a valid RP initiation occurs and attackers declare intent to raid, the defenders must accept the War Request. Refusing the request to use game protections as a shield is "Fail RP".

### C. Victory Conditions (Breach or Surrender)
There are two ways to win a raid. The defenders may choose either option:

- **The Hard Way (Combat)**: This involves combat where the attackers must achieve 4 defender kills to mechanically breach the base. The server uses a vanilla 'Hit Point' system where each kill damages the safehouse protection. Once this 4-kill threshold is reached, the game unlocks the containers for looting. This is a mechanical breach only; remember that narrative ownership always trumps mechanical control — once the raid is over, the base still belongs to the original owners. Fighting should end on both sides once the safehouse is breached, respawning players will act as hostages until the scene ends. Below are the looting limitations.

- **The Easy Way (Surrender)**: To avoid repeated deaths, the defenders may Surrender.

> **How it works**: The defender temporarily adds one attacker to the Safehouse Allow-list. This grants access to containers without further violence.

> **Safety**: Once a looting limitation is reached, the attacker must leave, and the defender removes them from the list immediately.

### D. Looting Limitations (The "Smash & Grab" Rule)
To prevent raiders from meticulously calculating inventory weight to clean a base out, the following restrictions apply:

- **The Designated Looter**: Strictly ONE person from the attacking group may enter to loot. All other attackers must remain on guard or interacting with the ‘hostages’.
- **The 3-Minute Timer**: Once the containers are accessible (via Breach or Surrender), the Designated Looter has exactly 3 Minutes to loot.
- **The Logic**: A raid is chaotic and fast. You do not have time to play "Inventory Tetris." Grab what looks valuable and get out.
- **Time's Up**: When 3 minutes are up or loot limit reached, the looter and group must exit the building immediately.
- **Personal Carry Only**: The looter may only take what they can physically carry (Inventory + Backpacks + Hands). No loading vehicles. One trip only, no swaps, once you grab it, you take it.

### E. Post-Raid Protocol (Release & Cooldown)
- **Release/Remove**: Once the loot is secured, the attackers must leave. You cannot keep the claim or occupy the base. The defenders can remove the designated looter after the 5-minute timer. We recommend timers always be ready for use in these cases. Give players a moment to react/type, please keep cool heads, all things can be replaced.
- **Cooldown**: A group may only attack the same target group once every 7 real-life days. Players, as much as it may suck, consider moving if this might be a repeated thing. Or get creative and create a stash house in the forests, keep the minimum around the main safehouse.

---

## 4. Group Separation & Dissolution (The "Divorce" Protocol)
Disagreements happen. Factions split. However, OOC ego must not destroy the gameplay environment.

### A. The "No Scorched Earth" Policy
- Structures built during a group's existence belong to the Base Location, not the specific builder.
- **No Dismantling**: If you leave a group (or are kicked), you are strictly forbidden from dismantling walls, destroying containers, or burning down structures simply because "you built them."

### B. Loot Distribution (The "Severance Package")
If an amicable agreement cannot be reached, the following Hard Limits apply to what the leaving player may take. The leaving player is entitled to:

- **Personal Property**: You may take the full contents of your designated "Personal Container" or "Bedroom" (Clothing, personal weapons, keepsakes).
- **Restriction**: You may not stash communal loot in your room right before leaving just to claim it.
- **The Survival Standard**: From the group's shared stockpile, you are entitled to a "Survival Kit" consisting of:
  - **Food/Water**: If available, up to 2 days' worth of rations if available.
  - **Medical**: If available, one standard First Aid Kit (x4 Bandages, disinfectant, painkillers).
  - **Defense**: If available, one melee and ranged weapon + 2 boxes of ammunition if available.
  - **Tools**: If available, give players a flashlight, 1 extra battery, a hammer, a saw, and up to 1 box of nails.
- **Transport**: You may take ONE working vehicle.
  - Priority: If you brought a car when you joined, you take that. If not, you take a standard-tier group vehicle, if there is more than one functional vehicle. You may also take your trailer if you had one or the group is willing to give you an extra.

### C. The "One Trip" Rule
Once you drive away, you are done. You cannot return for a "second load." Anything you leave behind becomes the property of the faction staying at the base.

### D. Keep it In-Character (IC)
- **No OOC Toxicity**: If a faction split devolves into personal insults or harassment in Discord, the aggressors will be removed. It is highly recommended if someone becomes toxic to not meet that energy, instead disengage, take screenshots, or record voice. They will be banned without a conversation about it. If there is no evidence we will have to treat all parties equally. We do not enjoy having to handle drama, our rules are pretty simple overall.
- **Solve it in RP**: If you feel you are owed more (e.g., *"I built the forge!"*), your character can threaten or bargain, but you cannot demand it OOC. Be prepared for consequences to your actions.

## 5. Mandatory Character Biography
To ensure high-quality roleplay and immersion, all players must create a character biography before joining the server for the first time. This helps you get into the mindset of your survivor and helps others interact with you meaningfully. Please post your bio in the designated Discord channel using the outline below.

### Simple Character Outline (Make it as complex as you like):
- **Character Name**: (First and Last)  
- **Steam64ID** (for whitelist):  
- **Age**:  
- **Occupation**: (What did they do before the apocalypse?)  
- **Physical Description**: (Hair, build, distinguishing features)  
- **Backstory/Personality**: (2–3 sentences about who they are, where they are from, or how they survived the first week.)

---

## 6. Realistic Character Builds (Stats & Traits)
We have provided extra character creation points to give you the freedom to build unique, fleshed-out survivors—not to create overpowered "Super Soldiers."

### A. No Min-Maxing or Exploits
- **The Sleep Rule**: Do not select sleep-related negative traits (e.g., *Sleepyhead*, *Restless Sleeper*). Since sleep is often disabled or modified in Multiplayer, these are considered "Free Points" exploits.
- **Point Hoarding**: The extra starting points are there so you aren't forced to take debilitating flaws just to be a functional character. Do not use this as an excuse to pile on more negatives just to buy every positive trait in the list.

### B. The "Super Soldier" Ban (Stat Limits)
- **No 9/9 Starting Builds**: Do not roll characters with maxed (9 or 10) Strength and Fitness. It is highly unlikely for any human to be an Olympic-level Strongman and a Marathon runner simultaneously.
- **The "Military" Excuse**: A military background is not a pass to max your stats. While soldiers are fit, very few are physical specimens in both categories.
- **There are ways to accelerate XP gain for fitness/strength in-game.** If you want to be a god of war, you have to earn it through gameplay training, not character creation.

### C. Narrative Consistency
- **Bio Alignment**: Your traits must make sense for your backstory. If you are an IT office worker, you should not have the "Axeman" and "Hunter" traits.
- **Negative Traits**: While we do not require you to strictly roleplay every mechanical negative trait (we know some are just for math), your roleplay cannot contradict them.
  - Example: If you take *"Illiterate"*, you cannot read maps or write notes in-character.

### D. Clothing Unlocked:
- All clothing options are unlocked for creative expression, not to give you a mechanical advantage at spawn.
- **Bio Consistency**: Your starting gear must be consistent with your character's biography.
- **No High Tier Gear**: Do not spawn with high-tier armor (e.g., firefighter gear, bulletproof vests) or large military backpacks unless your bio specifically and logically justifies it.
- **Consequence**: Abuse of this feature to create an overpowered starting character will result in being asked to remake your character.
- We can check character sheets and inventories. If we see violations, you will be asked to remake your character.

## 7. World Container Integrity (Loot the Contents, Not the Container)
To ensure that key locations remain viable for all players over the long term, the world's pre-existing infrastructure must be respected.

### A. The Core Rule
Players are strictly forbidden from picking up or dismantling pre-existing containers found in non-residential, key loot locations. These containers are essential for loot to spawn correctly for everyone.

### B. Affected Locations
This rule applies to, but is not limited to, the following areas:
- Police Stations & Courthouses (Gun lockers, evidence lockers)
- Fire Stations (Clothing lockers)
- Hospitals & Clinics (Medical cabinets, shelving)
- Military Installations (Barracks lockers, crates)
- Gun Stores & Hunting Lodges (Display cases, metal shelves)
- Large Warehouses & Factories (Crates, industrial shelving)

### C. Clarifications (What IS Allowed)
- **Barricading**: You are permitted to move a container within the same building to use it as a barricade (e.g., dragging a locker in front of a door).
- **Player-Made Containers**: This rule does not apply to any container you have crafted or placed yourself. You have full control over your own property.
- **Loose Containers**: This rule does not apply to containers found as loose loot items (e.g., an empty duffel bag on the floor).

### D. The "Why"
Loot spawns inside these world containers. If you take the container, you are effectively deleting future loot spawns for that location, which damages the server for everyone. Think of yourself as a visitor — take the supplies, but leave the shelves for the next person.

---

## 8. Game Exploits & Fair Play (Zero Tolerance Policy)
Our goal is to create a challenging and immersive survival experience. Using game exploits to bypass challenges, gain an unfair advantage, or disrupt the server is strictly forbidden and will be met with severe consequences.

### A. Definition of an Exploit
An exploit is defined as the abuse of a game mechanic or bug to achieve an unintended or unfair outcome. This includes, but is not limited to:
- **Duplication**: Intentionally duplicating items, vehicles, or characters.
- **Glitching**: Using glitches to get through walls, under the map, or into otherwise inaccessible areas.
- **Mechanic Abuse**: Abusing game mechanics in a way that is clearly not intended, such as animation canceling for unfair combat advantages or manipulating loot spawns, or carry weight.

### B. Consequences
We have a zero-tolerance policy for exploiting. The punishment will be swift and is not up for debate.

- **First Offense (Minor Exploit)**: If the exploit is minor and does not significantly impact other players (e.g., using a banned trait), you will be forced to remake your character from scratch. This includes the deletion of any skill journals or saved progress.
- **Second Offense / Major Exploit**: If the exploit is severe (e.g., item duplications, bypassing protections) or if it is your second offense, you will be permanently banned from the server and community without appeal.

### C. Reporting Bugs vs. Abusing Them
We understand that this is the Unstable Branch and bugs happen.

- If you find a bug: Report it to the admins immediately in the appropriate Discord channel; or don't even report it, just don't use it.
- If you abuse a bug: You are an exploiter.

Do not test our resolve on this. Play fair. Also we recognize some things are unavoidable because they just happen, like desync duplications, admins will use discernment when observing cases.

## 9. Vehicle Stewardship & Scrapping
Vehicles are a finite and critical resource. To ensure the long-term health of the server and provide opportunities for all players, we ask you to follow this code of conduct.

### A. Vehicle Hoarding & Community Etiquette
While we are not implementing a strict numerical limit on vehicle ownership, hoarding an excessive number of high-quality, functional vehicles is considered poor sportsmanship and is highly discouraged.

- **The Guideline**: Before taking another car, ask yourself: *"Do I need this vehicle for a specific purpose, or am I just collecting it?"* If your base has more pristine, ready-to-drive vehicles than active members in your group, you are likely hoarding. Please be mindful of other players.
- **Project Cars are Encouraged**: This guideline does not apply to towing wrecked or low-quality vehicles back to your base for long-term repair projects. We encourage you to be mechanics and bring junkers back to life!

### B. The "Leave it Drivable" Scrapping Protocol
You are strictly forbidden from removing essential, drive-critical parts from a vehicle that is in reasonably good condition, unless you intend to immediately drive that vehicle away.

> **What is a "Drivable" Vehicle?** A car is considered "Drivable" and therefore protected from being stripped of essential parts if it meets the following criteria:
> - Engine Quality is at or above 40%.
> - It has four functional tires.
> - It has a battery.
> - It has a driver’s seat.
> - It has a gas tank.
> - Anything not mentioned that is absolutely required for a vehicle to function.

> **The Rule of Thumb**: If you find a car that meets these conditions, you cannot leave a useless husk behind.

### C. Allowed Part Stripping (Non-Essential Parts)
You are permitted to remove non-essential, cosmetic, or storage parts from any vehicle, even if it is "Drivable."

> **Examples of Allowed Parts**: Hoods, trunk lids, doors, seats (except the driver's seat), windows, radios, and light bulbs.

> **The Logic**: This allows you to repair your own car's body or find a working radio without rendering another viable vehicle useless for the next person who finds it.

---

## 10. Communication (Radio & OOC)
### A. Radio Chat
- Global, faction and safehouse channels are disabled, whispers still work. You can find and use in-game walkies, radios and HAMs.
- The 'global' frequency players should stay tuned to is **"100.0"**. Create custom frequencies for faction or safehouse needs.
- Use `/say` or `/yell` when holding or next to a radio to speak into it. They have limited range, better type = better range, some vehicles have them.

### B. Out-of-Character (OOC) Chat
We are a Roleplay server, so please keep text chat "In Character" as much as possible. If you need to speak Out-of-Character (to discuss rules, bugs, or real-life interruptions), you must use brackets.

- **Correct**: `\\Be right back.`  
- **Correct**: `[Hey, my mic is glitching, one sec]`  
- **Correct**: `((Great scene guys, I have to go to work now.))`

---

## 11. Whitelist Entry & Unstable Branch Warning
Due to the strict roleplay nature of this community, the server is Whitelist Only. You must have your character biography approved in Discord before you can access the game server.

> **Important**: We operate on the **Unstable Branch** of Project Zomboid to utilize the latest features. By applying, you acknowledge and accept that:
> - You may encounter bugs, crashes, or broken mechanics.
> - Server wipes or rollbacks may be necessary if a game update breaks the save files.
> - Patience and understanding regarding technical issues are required.

Once you have read and agreed to all of the above and posted a character bio, with your Steam64ID posted so you can be added to the server whitelist; user names will be your character first and last name. Click the zombie below to acknowledge you have agreed to the rules and get the Project Zomboid Role.
