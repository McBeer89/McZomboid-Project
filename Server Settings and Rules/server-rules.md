# 📋 Server Rules

We're not a rulebook-heavy server, but a few things matter. Use common sense, treat people how you'd want to be treated in the apocalypse, and you'll be fine. The rules below exist to protect everyone's fun — not to be a burden.

## 1. Respect & Community

Be decent to each other. We're all adults here to unwind and have fun — not to deal with harassment, personal attacks, or aggressive behaviour. Toxicity gets you removed without much discussion.

That's it. Seriously, this one covers 90% of everything.

---

## 2. Theft & Robbery

We want to encourage interaction, even hostile interaction. You are a survivor, not an invisible ghost.

### A — No Ghost Theft

You cannot steal from another player without interacting with them first.

- No sneaking up on someone while they're looting or fishing to grab items from their pack or trunk without them noticing
- No hotwiring and driving off in a player's vehicle while they're nearby unless a proper robbery has been initiated

### B — Robbery Protocol *(The Highwayman Rule)*

To rob someone you must:

- **Reveal yourself** — be visually and verbally present. No robbing via chat while hiding in a bush, and no using camera angles to attack from above before RP begins
- **Issue a clear demand** — *"Hands up, drop the bag!"* or *"Step away from the car!"*

### C — Compliance vs. PvP

**If the victim complies** (hands up, stops moving):

- You **cannot kill them**
- **Fighting Chance Clause:** Leave the bare minimum to survive — don't take their last melee weapon, last bandage, food, water, clothing, or backpack
- **Loot OR Ride — pick one:**
  - Take their **gear** → they keep the vehicle
  - Take their **vehicle** → they keep their gear
  - You cannot take both

**If the victim resists or flees:**

- They consent to PvP and waive the protections above — if they lose, the aggressor may loot them fully
- **5-Second Rule:** Once PvP is agreed (can be confirmed OOC), a 5-second grace period must be observed so both sides can prepare

> **Note:** If the defender flees without any RP, the 5-second rule is void. If either side attacks or approaches aggressively without RP first, the other may freely defend themselves.

### D — Borrowing & Trading

Before going hostile, try talking. Many survivors will trade or give you a ride if you just ask. It's worth using Steam's recording tools or screenshots to document any major interactions.

---

## 3. Safehouse Wars (Raiding)

We use the **Claim War** mechanic to simulate raids. Abusing it to grief will get you banned.

### A — When a Raid is Valid

**Offline raiding is strictly forbidden.**

- **Solo player:** Their base may only be raided when *that player* is online
- **Faction (2+ members):** The base may only be raided when *over 50%* of active members are online and present at the location

### B — Initiation

- **RP first** — you cannot just click Claim War. Make yourself visually and verbally known, then give defenders **2 minutes** to react
- **Defenders must accept** — refusing the War Request to hide behind game protections is Fail RP

### C — Victory Conditions

**The Hard Way (Combat):** Attackers need **4 unique defender kills** to breach. Each kill damages safehouse protection; once the threshold is reached, containers unlock. Only one kill per defender counts toward the total — do not kill respawning defenders to pad the count. Fighting ends at breach — respawning defenders act as hostages until the scene wraps up.

**The Easy Way (Surrender):** Defenders temporarily add one attacker to the Safehouse Allow-list. Remove them once the looting limit is reached.

### D — Looting Limits *(Smash & Grab)*

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Designated Looter | **One person only** enters to loot — everyone else stays outside |
| Time Limit | **3 minutes** from the moment containers are accessible |
| Carry Limit | Personal carry only — inventory + backpacks + hands. No loading vehicles, no swaps, one trip |

A raid is chaotic and fast. You don't have time for inventory Tetris — grab what looks valuable and go.

### E — Post-Raid

- Leave immediately once loot is secured — you cannot occupy the base or keep the claim
- **7-day cooldown:** A group can only attack the same target once every 7 real-life days

---

## 4. Group Separation & Dissolution

Factions split. It happens. OOC ego does not get to destroy someone's gameplay experience on the way out.

### A — No Scorched Earth

Structures belong to the base, not the builder. If you leave or get kicked, you are **strictly forbidden** from dismantling walls, destroying containers, or burning anything down out of spite.

### B — The Severance Package

The leaving player is entitled to:

| Category | What You Can Take |
|---|---|
| Personal property | Full contents of your personal container or bedroom |
| Food & water | Up to 2 days' worth of rations *(if available)* |
| Medical | One standard first aid kit — bandages, disinfectant, painkillers *(if available)* |
| Defense | One melee weapon, one ranged weapon, 2 boxes of ammo *(if available)* |
| Tools | Flashlight, 1 extra battery, hammer, saw, up to 1 box of nails *(if available)* |
| Transport | One working vehicle — your original if you had one, otherwise a standard group vehicle |

> Don't try to stash communal loot in your personal container right before leaving to claim it.

### C — One Trip

Once you drive away, you're done. No coming back for a second load. Anything left behind belongs to the faction staying at the base.

### D — Keep It In-Character

If things get heated, handle it through RP — not OOC demands in Discord. Personal insults or harassment during a split will result in removal. If someone gets toxic, disengage and document it rather than matching their energy.

---

## 5. Mandatory Character Biography

Everyone needs a character bio before joining the server for the first time. It doesn't need to be a novel — a few lines is fine. Post it in the `#character-bios` Discord channel.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Character Name | First and last |
| Steam64ID | Required for whitelist |
| Age | Character's age |
| Occupation | Before the apocalypse |
| Physical Description | Hair, build, anything notable |
| Backstory / Personality | 2–3 sentences is plenty |

---

## 6. Realistic Character Builds

The extra starting points are there so you can build a *unique, fleshed-out survivor* — not a Super Soldier.

### A — No Min-Maxing

- **Sleep traits** (Sleepyhead, Restless Sleeper, etc.) are considered free point exploits since sleep is modified in multiplayer — don't take them
- Don't pile on extra negative traits purely to max out positives — that's the same kind of exploit in the other direction

### B — No Super Soldiers

- Don't create characters with maxed (9 or 10) **both** Strength and Fitness at the same time — it's not realistic
- A military background doesn't justify maxing both stats
- Want to be a powerhouse? **Earn it through in-game training**

### C — Narrative Consistency

- Your traits should make sense for your backstory — an IT worker probably shouldn't have Axeman and Hunter
- You don't have to obsessively roleplay every mechanical negative trait, but your RP can't flat-out contradict them (e.g. if you took Illiterate, you can't read maps in-character)

### D — Starting Gear & Clothing

All clothing options are unlocked for creative expression — not for mechanical advantage.

- Starting gear must match your bio
- Don't spawn in high-tier armor (firefighter gear, bulletproof vests) or military backpacks unless your bio clearly justifies it
- Admins can check character sheets and inventories — violations mean a character remake

---

## 7. Key Loot Locations — Don't Claim, Don't Strip

These locations exist for the whole server. Two rules apply to all of them:

1. **Don't claim them as a safehouse** — claiming a building stops loot from respawning inside it, cutting everyone else off from that resource permanently
2. **Don't remove or dismantle the containers** — loot spawns *inside* these containers; take the container and you delete future spawns for everyone

### Protected Locations

- Police Stations & Courthouses *(gun lockers, evidence lockers)*
- Fire Stations *(clothing lockers)*
- Hospitals & Clinics *(medical cabinets, shelving)*
- Military Installations *(barracks lockers, crates)*
- Gun Stores & Hunting Lodges *(display cases, metal shelves)*
- Large Warehouses & Factories *(industrial crates and shelving)*

### What IS Allowed

- **Barricading:** You can move a container *within the same building* to block a door
- **Loose loot containers:** Empty duffel bags and similar floor-loot items are fair game

> Take the supplies. Leave the shelves for the next person.

---

## 8. Game Exploits & Fair Play

We run a challenging, immersive server. Exploiting the game to bypass that is a zero-tolerance issue.

### What Counts as an Exploit

- **Duplication** — intentionally duplicating items, vehicles, or characters
- **Glitching** — getting through walls, under the map, or into otherwise inaccessible areas
- **Mechanic abuse** — animation canceling for combat advantage, manipulating loot spawns, circumventing carry weight

### Consequences

| Offense | Punishment |
|---|---|
| First offense *(minor)* | Forced character remake from scratch — includes skill journal deletion |
| Second offense or major exploit | Permanent ban, no appeal |

### Bugs vs. Exploits

If you find a bug — report it in Discord, or at minimum just don't use it.  
If you use a bug on purpose — you're an exploiter.

> Admins recognise that some things (like desync duplications) are genuinely unavoidable and will use discretion. Play fair and you'll never have to worry about it.

---

## 9. Vehicle Stewardship

Vehicles are finite. Look after them.

### A — Don't Hoard

No strict numerical limit, but hoarding more working vehicles than you have active group members is poor sportsmanship. Ask yourself: *"Do I actually need this, or am I just collecting it?"*

Towing wrecks back for repair projects is totally fine and encouraged.

### B — Leave It Drivable

You cannot strip drive-critical parts from a vehicle that still runs. A vehicle is considered **drivable** if it has:

- Engine quality at or above 40%
- Four functional tires
- A battery
- A driver's seat
- A gas tank

Don't leave a useless husk behind.

### C — What You Can Strip

Non-essential parts are fair game on any vehicle, even a drivable one:

> Hoods, trunk lids, doors, seats *(except driver's)*, windows, radios, light bulbs

---

## 10. Communication

### Radio

- Global, faction, and safehouse channels are **disabled** — whispers still work
- Find and use in-game walkies, radios, and HAM radios. Better gear = better range. Some vehicles have built-in radios
- **Global frequency:** `100.0` — all players should stay tuned here. Create custom frequencies for faction or safehouse use
- Use `/say` or `/yell` while holding or standing next to a radio to speak into it

### Out-of-Character (OOC) Chat

Keep text chat in-character where possible. If you need to step outside the RP — rules, bugs, real life — wrap it in brackets:

```
\\Be right back.
[Hey, my mic is glitching, one sec]
((Great scene everyone, I have to log off now.))
```

---

## 11. Whitelist & Unstable Branch

The server is **whitelist only** — not to be exclusive, just to keep the player base manageable on Build 42 and make sure everyone's on the same page with the RP basics.

**To get whitelisted:**

1. Post a character bio with your Steam64ID in `#character-bios`
2. React with the zombie emoji to confirm you've read the rules
3. An admin will add you once your bio is approved

**By joining, you accept that:**

- You may encounter bugs, crashes, or broken mechanics
- Server wipes or rollbacks may be necessary if an update breaks the save
- Patience is required — it comes with the territory on an unstable branch
