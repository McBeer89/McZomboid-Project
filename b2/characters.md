## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Hutchins Family

---

### Gary Hutchins
**Age:** 46 | **Pre-collapse:** Electrical contractor, owner-operator of Hutchins Electric

Big man gone thick through the middle. Broad shoulders, rough hands, short graying hair. Work boots and jeans every day like a uniform. Two years Army Reserve in his early twenties. Built his business from a truck and a license.

**Traits:** Patient, deliberate, reads rooms before entering them. Thinks in arithmetic — resources, risk, time. Leads by competence, not charisma. Quiet preparer since 1987, not from ideology but from a practical man's distrust of what the world was telling him. Protective without being performative about it. Running a mental tab of everything he owes and everyone he's failed to help.

**Strengths:** Calm under pressure. Practical intelligence. Earns trust from military and civilian alike by being visibly competent. Makes hard calls and lives with them.

**Flaws:** Carries weight silently until it bends him. Struggles with loss of control — needs to be the decision-maker, and environments where he has no standing cost him. Can become rigid when the arithmetic says one thing and the human cost says another.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Stopped the group at a gas station on a county road north/east of Harlan, night of July 14. Killed his first infected — Dale, the gas station owner, with a tire iron. Two swings. The first wrong, the second final. Dragged the body into the bathroom and closed the door before bringing the group inside. Jesse saw him come out with the iron and understood; neither spoke about it. This is a threshold moment — the knowing became doing, and the cost is in his hands. Admitted "I don't know" to Diane about destination — the first time since July 4th. Named east as the direction: rural, small towns, the most time before the worst catches up. Not a destination — a logic. Leading again, the tab longer than ever. Vasquez and Morrow still unaccounted for. The group of nine is his responsibility. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Diane Hutchins (née Carver)
**Age:** 38 | **Pre-collapse:** ER nurse, Cortman Medical Center

Compact, dark hair in a practical knot, sharp brown eyes. Moves without waste.

**Traits:** Assesses before she engages. Clinical precision applied to everything — emotions included, which is both a strength and a wall. Uses work as a coping mechanism; the discipline of nursing is the wall between functioning and falling apart. Says what she means without softening it. Watches people the way she watches patients — for what they do, not what they say.

**Strengths:** Medical expertise is the group's most critical asset. Reads people with diagnostic accuracy. Emotionally steady in crisis. Carries more knowledge about the outbreak's mechanism than almost anyone in the civilian population.

**Flaws:** The wall between function and feeling is load-bearing. What she saw at Cortman on July 3rd is still in her. That weight doesn't leave.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Group medic, fully operational. Examined Del at the gas station — ribs 7 and 8 broken, possible hairline on 9, no pneumothorax. Wrapped his ribs, gave him the limits: no lifting, no twisting, six weeks minimum. Moved through the group with the diagnostic eye — assessed everyone without announcing it. Sat with Amy briefly; didn't ask if she was okay, told her "you're here, we're here, tomorrow is tomorrow." Had the private moment with Gary — the "where do we go" conversation. Received "I don't know" and accepted it. East. The wall between function and feeling is still load-bearing and she's still working, which is how she holds it up. Left a note for Vasquez at the medical station before departing Harlan — the frequency (7.285 MHz), the direction (east), and two words: "Find us." **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Jesse Hutchins
**Age:** 16

His father's height, still lean, dark hair worn a little long. A face learning to close. Dark circles.

**Traits:** Observant beyond his years and getting more so by the day. Builds a curriculum from the people around him — watches soldiers for threat assessment, studies his father for decision-making, learns from journalists how to hold information and shape it. Transparent by nature, learning opacity out of necessity. Processes internally before speaking. When he speaks, it's precise.

**Strengths:** Adaptive intelligence. Reads emotional states accurately. Growing ability to function through fear. The intellectual framework he's building is becoming operational — not just observation but action.

**Flaws:** Sixteen. Still forming. The intellectual framework can become a substitute for feeling — he analyzes when he should grieve. The weight of what he processes daily is accumulating faster than his ability to metabolize it.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Running on fumes. Two days of maximum output — the July 4th recount to Lena, carrying Lily through the escape, getting Amy moving, going back for Del, and now this. Saw Gary come out of the gas station with the tire iron and understood what had happened inside. Neither spoke. The curriculum now includes watching his father cross a line. Working the intelligence relay with Lena — heard the shortwave reports of the collapse (perimeter breach, Louisville evacuating, outbreaks outside the zone) and carried it to Gary. Learning calibration from Lena: "your dad gets all of it, the rest we calibrate." Amy is in his orbit; the thread remains primed but unstarted. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Lily Hutchins
**Age:** 7

Small for her age, her mother's dark eyes, her father's jaw when she sets it. Hair in two braids. Carries a yellow Sony Walkman.

**Traits:** Pays more attention than anyone wants her to. Quiet, watchful, processes through observation and physical objects rather than language. The Walkman is her anchor — not the music but the act of pressing play, the ritual of it. Brave in the way children are brave when they don't know the alternative. Finds connections the adults don't engineer.

**Strengths:** Emotional barometer for the group. Doesn't freeze. Doesn't perform distress for attention.

**Flaws:** Seven. Processing a world-ending event through a seven-year-old's framework, which means the feelings arrive without the language to hold them.

> **⚠️ Status**
> The tremor from the Harlan escape stopped during the drive — whether temporary resolution or pause is unclear. At the gas station, went to Amy on her own initiative — no one told her to. Sat beside her. Put the headphones on, pressed play on the blank tape, placed one headphone pad against Amy's knee. The hiss shared between them. This is the closing image of the Harlan Arc: two girls in the dark, the sound of nothing playing. The Walkman ritual has expanded from self-soothing to connection — Lily is doing for Amy what the tape does for her. Anchor for Amy is now active, not potential. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

## 🏚️ Harlan Civilians — Traveling with the Family

---

### Del Norris
**Age:** Mid-50s | **Background:** Warehouse foreman, south Louisville

Broad shoulders, foreman's hands, close-cropped gray hair. A particular exhausted fury — past panic, into something colder and more useful.

**Traits:** Practical, direct, says what he's seen without embellishment. The kind of man who drives into a disaster zone to check on his mother and then watches a blockade for six hours because leaving without answers isn't in his wiring. Anger is his fuel, but it's productive anger — pointed, not scattered.

**Strengths:** Physical toughness. Reliable under pressure. Acts on instinct when someone needs protecting, regardless of the cost to himself.

**Flaws:** Fifty-five and burning fuel he doesn't have. Mother in Vine Grove — inside the zone, unaccounted for.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Diagnosed by Diane at the gas station: ribs 7 and 8 broken, possible hairline on 9. No flail segment, no pneumothorax. Wrapped. Can walk, ride, talk. Cannot lift, twist, fight, or take a deep breath without paying for it. Six weeks minimum recovery — the foreman who saved Amy by holding her now needs help getting out of the truck. The injury inverts his role and changes his physicality for the foreseeable future. Accepted Diane's orders with his particular exhausted fury. The Amy/Del thread is planted — he broke his ribs holding her, said the words her parents would have said. That foundation accrues. His mother in Vine Grove remains unresolved. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Ruth
**Age:** Late 50s | **Background:** Father ran a plumbing operation in Bowling Green. Something in her past explains her — not yet revealed.

**Traits:** Practical, unsentimental, past the point of softening things. Tells people what they need to know before they ask. Manages what people are *ready for*, not just what they know. Reads situations two steps ahead of the need. Doesn't perform authority; just has it.

**Strengths:** Organizational intelligence. Social reading. The kind of person who is already packed before anyone announces they're leaving.

**Flaws:** Backstory is unrevealed, which means her motivations are partially opaque. Unsentimental can shade into cold when warmth is what people need.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Skills translating to the road. No clipboard — organizing by hand and memory. Inventoried the group's supplies at the gas station: fourteen cans, six water jugs, two blankets, medical kit, plus whatever's left on the shelves. Held the flashlight for Diane's examination of Del — practical, no commentary. Sat with Lily while Jesse went to the back room for the shortwave. Foil for Gary continues: she organizes from within, he leads from the front. Her backstory remains unrevealed. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Lena Park
**Age:** Late 20s | **Background:** Reporter, Louisville Courier-Journal. Korean-American. Trapped inside the zone while covering the "flu story."

Still, attentive, reads every room. Carries a notebook and a portable shortwave radio.

**Traits:** Asks questions smaller than they sound. Calibrates what to tell people and in what order. Believes someone will eventually need to know what happened here and is making sure the record exists. The notebook is not just journalism — it's an act of faith that the future will care.

**Strengths:** Intelligence gathering and synthesis. Connects patterns others miss. The shortwave gives the group access to information no one else inside the zone has.

**Flaws:** The journalist's instinct to record and calibrate can conflict with the human need to just be present. More information isn't always better when people are at capacity.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Set up the shortwave at the gas station and pulled in the collapse: degrading military frequencies (perimeter sections non-recoverable, units consolidating north), a ham operator in Shepherdsville reporting refugees flooding north on I-65 and sick people outside the zone, and a woman in Lexington aggregating reports statewide ("you are not alone, this is a civil emergency, help each other"). The world outside the zone is starting to sound like the world inside it. Confirmed the aerial strain pattern — people sick without bites. Notebook still closed since the escape. The intelligence relay with Jesse continues; she's teaching him calibration: who gets what information and when. Her record remains the only comprehensive account. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Amy Briars
**Age:** 16

Dark blond hair in a loose braid. Patient, available in the way of someone who has exhausted the options and arrived at stillness.

**Traits:** Quiet, receptive, capable of sitting with discomfort without performing it. Understands that presence is enough. The kind of person who shares silence rather than filling it.

**Strengths:** Emotional availability. Connects with people through being rather than doing.

**Flaws:** What she becomes under grief is unwritten.

> **⚠️ Status**
> In shock. At the gas station: against the wall, knees up, head down, making the sound of nothing. Diane sat with her briefly — told her "you're here, we're here, tomorrow is tomorrow." Amy registered it physically (one deeper breath) but couldn't respond. Lily came to her unprompted, sat beside her, pressed play on the blank Walkman, placed one headphone pad against Amy's knee. Amy's shoulders loosened a fraction. The structure she'd built around herself held but shifted. The grief has not arrived — she's in the space between the event and the understanding of the event. The breakdown will come later, triggered by something small. The pulling-together-after is the real arc. Lily is her anchor. The Jesse thread remains primed. The Del thread is planted. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

---

### Marcus
**Age:** Mid-30s | **Background:** Louisville criminal underground, vehicle theft specialty. Alone.

Alert stillness. Eyes that move systematically. Never wastes a position.

**Traits:** Vague about his past, specific about what he's seen. Professional — applies criminal tradecraft (vehicle assessment, situational reading, exit planning) with the precision of someone who survived by being smarter than his environment. Does not perform loyalty; demonstrates it through action.

**Strengths:** Vehicle skills, situational awareness, exit strategy thinking. Sees collapse coming before others because he's spent his life reading when situations turn.

**Flaws:** Trust is transactional by training. His history means the group will always be slightly uncertain about him until he's been tested repeatedly.

> **⚠️ Status**
> The group's security perimeter. At the gas station: circuited the building, lot, and tree line within three minutes of arrival. Positioned on the Suburban's hood watching the road — the systematic scan running on the same frequency it always runs on. Held convoy interval on the drive north — fifty yards, disciplined. The compact with Gary is tested and held. First real group integration still pending — he's settled as useful but his relationship to anyone other than Gary is undeveloped. The complication may still be ahead. **Not yet revisited in Book Two.**

## 🪖 Military — Morrow's Squad (Traveling East)

---

### Sergeant First Class Elena Vasquez
**Age:** 34 | **MOS:** 11B Infantryman, senior NCO | Fifteen years in the Army

Compact, direct, dark hair pulled tight, brown eyes that move constantly. Small scar on her right knuckles. Does not fill silence.

**Traits:** Clearest thinker in the group. Watches everything, announces nothing. Makes decisions before she announces them; by the time she says something, she's already committed. The kind of person who carries things she hasn't said yet and you don't notice until she's gone. Loyalty runs to people, not structure, which is rare in a career NCO.

**Strengths:** Tactical intelligence. Reads institutional failure with precision. Invaluable because her loyalty is earned, not automatic.

**Flaws:** Fifteen years of institutional loyalty don't dissolve cleanly. Crossing lines costs something internal that hasn't been examined yet.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Watched the institution collapse from the inside across July 14. Lost posts throughout the morning — Hodge, Yates, then a third from Post Seven. The east sector went unmanned. Warned Diane that consolidation could be today; Diane told her "don't be on the wrong side of this." When the perimeter broke at 1430, Vasquez was inside the machinery of collapse — relaying orders, directing soldiers, filing the mental report that would never be written. At 1500, went to the medical station and found it empty. Diane's shelf selectively packed — medications gone, instruments left. Found Diane's note behind the bandages: the frequency (7.285 MHz), the direction (east), "Find us." Put the note in her breast pocket. Walked to the motor pool instead of the armory. Met Morrow's squad at the east gate Humvee. The exchange: "Sergeant." "Sergeant." Two words, the entire conversation. Now riding passenger in the Humvee, the note in her pocket, the frequency in her head. The fifteen years of institutional loyalty crossed a line and arrived on the other side. The reasons were moral — different from Morrow's structural reasons, same vehicle, same direction.

---

### Sergeant Dale Morrow
**Age:** 32 | **MOS:** 11B Infantryman | Born Dothan, Alabama

Six foot even, going leaner than he used to be. Dark hair cut close, lined around the eyes from too much sun over too many years. Moves with deliberate economy. Left sleeve rolled down and buttoned regardless of the heat.

**Traits:** Structure is water to him — he needs it the way some people need certainty. Enlisted at eighteen because it was the most structured exit available. Good at soldiering, better at people. Reads his men the way Gary reads rooms. Has a daughter in Georgia he hasn't called since July 1st.

**Strengths:** Leadership through earned trust. Holds a squad together through institutional collapse. Knows when to follow and when to lead. The Morrow/Gary dynamic is the story's core civilian-military relationship.

**Flaws:** Institutional loyalty runs deep. Carries loss quietly; the daughter in Georgia is a constant background frequency.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Squad dissolved at 1100 by SFC Kimball under the consolidation directive — Reyes to Paulson's fire team, Cutler to motor pool ops, Webb to north barracks holding detail. Found Shores' bunk stripped, dog tags on the pillow. Picked up the tags, put them in his pocket. Did not report Shores' absence: "Some absences were a dereliction. This one was a son." At 1620, received orders from Lt. Paulson to hold the south interior fence — recognized it as a delay, a speed bump made of soldiers to buy time for command's evacuation north. Said "Copy, sir" and walked to the motor pool. Collected Reyes, Cutler, and Webb. Found Cutler's prepared Humvee. Left through the east gate. The Greer beat: thirty yards of open ground, one nod each, opposite directions. Now driving east on county roads, following tire tracks from the family's two vehicles. The structure that was water to him is running on something else now — not rebellion, not moral clarity like Vasquez. A calculation: the institution no longer existed in the form that made its orders legitimate. His people. His call. Shores' dog tags still in his pocket. Daughter in Georgia still unreachable.

---

### Corporal Luis Reyes
**Age:** 29 | **MOS:** 11B, designated marksman | Two deployments — Panama '89, brief assignment '91

Lean, dark, close-cropped black hair, eyes that don't settle. Scar on left jaw, unexplained. Almost always at the periphery.

**Traits:** Thinks in sequences, stripped of sentiment. Watches tree lines. Carries information until it has operational value, then delivers it without editorializing.

**Strengths:** Best shooter in the group. Calm under threat. Provides the security perimeter others rely on without being asked.

**Flaws:** The periphery is also where you go to avoid connection. Whatever he saw coming down from West Point is still unspoken.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Was at the motor pool fence watching the east tree line when Morrow said "We're leaving." Two-second assessment. Nodded — not agreement, acknowledgment. Fell in. Already in the back of the Humvee, rifle across knees, eyes on the tree line when the others arrived. On the road east: ran the scan — road, tree line, mirrors, road — the sequence his body performed without his mind's permission. Spotted the tire tracks on the asphalt. Fresh, two sets, two vehicles heading east at moderate speed. Filed it without announcement: the family's Ford Bronco and Chevy Suburban. Hours ahead based on track degradation. The chapter's closing lens — watching the dark, the tire marks, Harlan glowing orange behind them. The periphery man reading the margins, which is where the important information always lives.

---

### Specialist Ray Cutler
**Age:** 26 | **MOS:** 91B Light Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic

Stocky, hands always dirty, sweats constantly. Wipes palms on thighs before touching anything mechanical.

**Traits:** Mechanical genius, not ideological about service. Does the job. Pragmatic, reliable, low-drama.

**Strengths:** The group's mechanic. Essential when vehicles are the story.

**Flaws:** Not a leader, not a talker.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Had been building the escape vehicle for four days — since the generator failed on the east side. An M998 Humvee, off the regular vehicle rotation: engine running clean, fuel gauge full, two jerry cans strapped to the rear cargo rack (twenty gallons reserve — four hundred miles total range). Field radio mounted to dash — AN/VRC-series, military frequencies and civilian shortwave both. Behind the seats: MREs, water cans, tool kit in canvas roll, ammunition boxes, medical kit assembled from three sources. "I know. Been working on it." The preparation was itself the decision — the wrench that said what the mouth didn't. Delivered the Humvee to the east gate in three minutes. Now in the Humvee's back center seat, hands on knees, listening to the engine with the evaluative attention of a man who would know by sound and vibration if anything was wrong before the instruments told him.

---

### Private Aaron Webb
**Age:** 19 | **MOS:** 11B

Tall, angular, long neck. Still growing into his frame. Quiet, deferent, stands half a step behind whoever is nearest. Arrived at Fort Knox forty-eight hours before the phones went dead.

**Traits:** First posting. Carries something from the field that he doesn't have language for.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Was at the north barracks holding detail — spare bodies, institutional storage. Standing at the doorway with his rifle and the half-second vacancy. Morrow didn't order him; told him what was happening and asked him to come. "Is there somewhere to go?" / "I don't know. But there's nothing to stay for." Picked up his pack. Fell in behind Morrow — not because the order was there but because the man was there, and the man was the last structure that hadn't dissolved. Now in the Humvee's back right seat, pack between his feet, face turned toward the window. The vacancy softened by something that might be exhaustion or the first thing past exhaustion. The half-second vacancy remains unresolved. Track but don't invest heavily — yet.

---

## 🪖 Military — Separated / Independent

---

### PFC Kenny Shores
**Age:** 20 | **MOS:** 11B | From Elizabethtown, Kentucky — twenty minutes outside the zone

Sandy-haired, freckled, open face. Looks younger than twenty. Always doing something small with his hands.

**Traits:** Eight months enlisted. First posting. The youngest and most transparent member of the military group. Easy, uninvited sociability — the kid who talked too much and meant all of it. Formerly optimistic. Interior voice is direct, concrete, unarmored — thinks *at* things rather than around them or through them. The anti-Morrow, the anti-Gary: impulse shaped by training, feeling first, framework second. Mother and younger brother Tyler (17) in Elizabethtown. Father absent — never discussed, never in the picture, the family was the three of them.

**Strengths:** Training gives him tools — he can move quietly, use cover, read sightlines. Physically capable. The openness that makes him vulnerable also makes him the most human voice in the cast. Potential sleeper character.

**Flaws:** Twenty. Alone. Running on a brother's math instead of a plan. The simple arithmetic that keeps him moving is also the thing that walked him into a dead town with a rifle and no backup.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch2 — "Twenty Minutes")**
> Left Harlan in the dark hours of July 13–14. Walked west through the night toward Elizabethtown. Arrived late morning July 14. Found the town fully overrun — the first extended look at civilian collapse outside an institutional setting. Navigated through using training: low, quiet, cover-to-cover. The town is his town — every house, every street, the gas station, the elementary school. The scale of the overrun dawned through accumulation, not spectacle.
>
> Reached 114 Culver Road. Tyler's truck gone from the driveway (oil stain on concrete, space empty). Entered the house. Found his mother's bedroom door locked from the outside — Tyler had locked it after she died of the "flu." Shores picked the lock with a bobby pin, the way he learned as a kid. Opened the door. **The gap: we do not narrate what happened in the room.** Resumed on Shores after — blood on his hands and forearms, wiped but not clean, dark under fingernails. The bayonet cleaned and resheathed. He put his mother down.
>
> Checked Tyler's room: drawers pulled open, closet half-emptied, backpack gone, good sneakers gone. The specific chaos of a teenager packing fast and leaving on purpose. Tyler was there when their mother got sick, locked the door after she died, packed, and drove. Tyler is alive — or alive enough for Shores to hold onto.
>
> Took supplies from the kitchen. Took the family photo — Sears portrait, the three of them, no father. Into the breast pocket. Left through the back door. Did not return to the bedroom.
>
> Fought two infected at the south edge of town near the Valley Creek bridge. Silent — couldn't shoot, used the bayonet and rifle stock. Messy, desperate, physical. Muttered to himself: "Come on, Kenny." The fight cost him physically — adrenaline crash, shaking hands, spent.
>
> Found a Chevy pickup on the road shoulder past the bridge. Mid-'80s work truck, driver belted in and turned. Tank full, bag packed in the passenger seat — someone who planned to leave and didn't make it. Cleared the driver, took the truck. The first thing that went right all day.
>
> Now driving south on back roads outside Elizabethtown. Not east like everyone else — south because south is where the road went when he came out of town. A satellite, not a trailing vehicle. His hands are shaking but they're on the wheel. The photo is in his pocket. The brother is the reason. Tyler packed a bag. Tyler took his truck. Tyler got out. Finding Tyler is the only equation that matters.
>
> **Key items carried:** Rifle with bayonet, pack with basic gear, family photo (breast pocket), supplies from the house, Chevy pickup (full tank). Morrow has his dog tags.
>
> **Open threads:** Tyler's location (unknown — drove out before the town fell). Direction of travel (south, divergent from all other groups). Physical and psychological cost of the day accumulating. The formerly optimistic kid is compressed but not broken — the openness is still there, turned inward. Convergence with main group requires a turn — he doesn't know they went east.

---

### Tyler Shores
**Age:** 17 | Kenny's younger brother

Not yet on page. Known only through evidence at 114 Culver Road.

**Traits:** Unknown directly. Evidence suggests practical under pressure — locked his mother's bedroom door after she died, understanding what comes after. Packed in a hurry but not in panic. Took the essentials. Left on purpose.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch2 — evidence only)**
> Was at the house on Culver Road when his mother got sick with the "flu." She died. Tyler locked the bedroom door. Packed his room — clothes, backpack, good sneakers. Took his truck (late-model Ford Ranger, beater, bought with summer job money from the hardware store). Drove. Direction unknown. Timeline: left before the town was fully overrun, likely early in the collapse. Not confirmed alive — but the evidence (packed room, deliberate departure, locked door) suggests a functioning, thinking seventeen-year-old who made a plan and executed it. Kenny's entire forward motivation rests on finding him.

---

### First Lieutenant Paul Greer
**Age:** 27 | **MOS:** 11A Infantry Officer | ROTC, Ohio State. Eagle Scout. Commissioned 1989.

Medium height, lean, upright bearing. Brown hair, regulation cut, clean-shaven. Face still young enough to be readable.

**Traits:** Institutionalist. The mission, the orders, the chain. Eagle Scout earnestness is real but so is the pull of structure. Working hard to be the kind of officer who means it when he says "we are not leaving people."

**Strengths:** Competent. Fast tactical assessment. Genuine conviction about protecting civilians.

**Flaws:** The institution is the lens he sees through. When the institution makes decisions he wouldn't have made independently, the lens wins.

> **⚠️ Status (B2 Ch1)**
> Stayed with the institution during the collapse of Checkpoint Harlan. In the doorway of the command block — one hand on the frame, half-turned toward the interior, lit by the overhead bulb (the last powered section of the compound). The face Morrow had known since the convoy from Fort Knox — the lieutenant who'd ridden the same road and then walked back into the institution. Not quite the man from the road. Not quite the man the compound had made him. Something between them. The beat: thirty yards of open ground, one nod each, opposite directions, neither direction wrong in the terms of the man walking it. Then he turned back into the command block and the doorway was empty. His trajectory follows command's northern evacuation, wherever that consolidates to. May resurface. The road Greer remains underneath the institutional Greer — the nod confirmed it.

---

### Specialist Darnell Cross
**Age:** 23 | **MOS:** 11B

Broad-shouldered, unhurried. Checks bootlaces before moving — left one first.

**Traits:** Steady. Background presence.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Part of Greer's unit. Stayed with institutional structure during the Harlan collapse. Presumably part of the northern evacuation. Not actively tracked.

---

### Private First Class Owen Briggs
**Age:** 20 | **MOS:** 11B

Medium height, fair-skinned, blond. A vacancy behind the eyes.

**Traits:** Carries weight he hasn't spoken about. The vacancy is visible to anyone paying attention.

> **⚠️ Status**
> Inside Harlan at the time of the collapse. Background character. No longer actively tracked. Was present for both deaths of Greer's missing soldiers — handled the immediate situation with Pawlowski before Greer finished it. Has not spoken of it. His weight exists in the story through Greer's telling in Ch. 9. Presumably part of the command's northern evacuation or dispersed during the collapse.

---

## 💀 Deceased

---

### Private Tommy Hicks
**Age:** 21 | **MOS:** 11B

Died of illness in the truck bed, morning of July 10th. Greer handled the situation personally. Logged at Harlan — a form, a separate board, two sentences.

Had a girlfriend named Janet in Memphis who does not know.

---

### Frank & Carol Briars
**Ages:** Frank early 60s, Carol late 40s | Farmers, rural stretch between West Point and the zone's eastern edge

Did not make it out of Harlan. Frank's arm wound slowed him. Carol wouldn't leave him. They are not confirmed dead on page — they fell behind, the gap widened, and the sound in the gap was enough.

---

### Mrs. Shores (first name unestablished)
**Age:** ~40s–50s | Kenny and Tyler's mother. Single parent. Elizabethtown, Kentucky — 114 Culver Road.

Died of the "flu" at home, sometime between July 10–13. Tyler was present, locked her bedroom door after she died. Reanimated. Kenny arrived July 14, picked the lock, and put her down. She was making a peanut butter sandwich when she got too sick to finish it. The bread was still on the counter.

The family was the three of them. No father — never discussed, never in the pictures. The garden hose was coiled on its hook because a coiled hose was a tended yard and a tended yard was a woman who had her life in order.

*Last updated: Post-Book Two, Chapter Two.*
