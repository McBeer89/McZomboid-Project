# Chapter Two — *"Twenty Minutes"*

**July 14, 1993 — Elizabethtown, Kentucky**

---

He could smell it before he could see it.

The Knox odor — the sulfur-copper taste that had been in the back of his throat since before the phones died — was different here. Thicker. Layered with something underneath it that his body knew and his mind didn't want to name, something sweet and wrong that the July heat pulled out of everything it touched and held in the air like a stain.

Shores stopped at the tree line where the county road widened into the first stretch of shoulder. Ahead of him, the outskirts of Elizabethtown. A BP station on the left, its canopy still standing, the pumps dark. A Hardee's across the road, the drive-through sign still lit — which meant the power was on somewhere, or had been recently, or the sign was running on a generator that nobody had turned off. Beyond that, the rooftops. The water tower. The steeple of First Baptist on Main Street, visible above the tree line the same way it had been visible every morning of his life when he walked to the bus stop on Culver Road.

Twenty minutes. That's what his mother had said when the news started talking about the Knox County quarantine. *We're twenty minutes outside. They've got the whole Army up there.* She'd said it the way she said everything — practical, factored, the single mother's arithmetic that had run the Shores household since before Kenny was old enough to understand why there was no one else doing the math. Twenty minutes was a specific distance. Twenty minutes meant safe.

He adjusted the rifle on his shoulder. The pack straps were cutting into the skin above his collarbones — twelve hours of walking, most of it in the dark, the weight redistributing itself against muscles that had stopped complaining around 0300 and started simply informing him, in the flat language of exhaustion, that they were still operational but would like it noted.

The walk from Harlan had been long and dark and he had not let himself think during most of it. Thinking was a door and behind the door was the thing that had made him walk in the first place — his mother's birthday passing without a call, without a card, without her son standing in the kitchen on Culver Road saying *happy birthday, Mom* while she pretended she hadn't been waiting for it. July 12th. He'd been standing at a guard post on the west perimeter of a military compound watching a fence line that nobody was going to attack, and his mother had turned fifty miles away, and the phones were dead, and the only thing between him and Culver Road was a gap in the rotation that the consolidation had opened like a door left unlocked.

So he'd walked through it. Not desertion — not the way he thought about it, though he understood that the paperwork would say otherwise. A son. He was a son before he was a soldier, and the soldier part had lasted eight months and the son part had lasted twenty years and the math wasn't complicated.

The math was never complicated. That was the problem with Kenny Shores. The math was always simple and the simple was always right and the simple was going to get him killed someday, except someday was a concept that had stopped meaning what it used to mean about two weeks ago.

He moved.

---

The first block of Meadowbrook subdivision was empty in the way that a place is empty when the people left and nothing has moved in yet. Cars in driveways. Lawns going shaggy — ten days of July growth without a mower, the grass already ankle-high in places, dandelions pushing through the cracks in the sidewalks. A sprinkler head sticking up from a flower bed, dry, the timer still set for a schedule that nobody was going to follow.

Front doors closed. Some locked. Some not — he could tell by the ones that sat slightly ajar, the latch not catching, the heat expanding the frames. A tricycle on a porch. A garbage can at the curb, the lid off, the bag inside swollen and dark and humming with flies. Tuesday pickup. The garbage truck had not come on Tuesday.

His training told him to scan. His body was doing it — the left-right sweep of the street, the check of windows and doorways and the gaps between houses where the backyards connected and someone could come through without being seen from the road. He'd learned the scan on the convoy from Fort Knox, watching Reyes do it from the passenger seat with the automatic efficiency of a man who didn't know he was doing it anymore. Shores was not Reyes. Shores had to think about the scan, remind his eyes to keep moving, override the thing that kept pulling his attention forward, toward the end of the subdivision, toward Culver Road, toward the house.

But the scan showed him things.

A window broken on the Campbell house — not the front window, the side, the one that faced the backyard. Glass on the ground outside, which meant it had been broken from inside. The blinds hanging crooked through the gap. Something had gone through that window, or someone had. The Campbells had two kids. Shores had mowed their lawn twice the summer before he enlisted.

He kept moving. Low, close to the parked cars, using the vehicles as cover the way the training said. The rifle was slung but the bayonet was accessible — the snap on the sheath loosened, the handle positioned for a quick draw. He couldn't shoot. He knew that the way he knew the smell was wrong: not as information but as a rule that lived in his body. Shooting in Elizabethtown would be the same as shouting in Elizabethtown. Sound carried. Sound drew them. The rifle was weight and leverage and a blade on the end, and that was all it was until he was somewhere empty enough to afford the noise.

He crossed Millbrook Drive and the town opened up. The commercial strip — Kroger plaza on the left, the parking lot dotted with abandoned cars, some with their doors open, some with their trunks raised as if someone had been loading groceries and stopped. The Kroger's windows were smashed. Not one — all of them, the whole front, the glass scattered across the sidewalk in a pattern that looked like it had been there for days, ground into fragments by foot traffic and weather. Inside, darkness and the smell.

He saw the first one.

It was in the Kroger parking lot, forty yards away, standing between a minivan and a pickup truck. A woman. She was wearing a housecoat — pale blue, the kind his mother had, the kind every mother in Elizabethtown had, the shapeless quilted thing that came out in the morning and went back in the closet before company arrived. Her feet were bare. Her skin was the color of something that had been in the sun too long. She was standing the way they stood — not planted, not balanced, the weight distributed on joints that weren't being managed anymore. Swaying. Her head was tilted to one side like she was listening to something only she could hear.

Shores stopped. Pressed himself against the bed of a Ford Ranger parked at the curb. Controlled his breathing. Watched.

The woman in the housecoat didn't move. Didn't look toward him. The distance was safe and the wind was wrong for carrying his scent — if they used scent; nobody had told him whether they used scent — and the forty yards might as well have been a mile as long as he didn't make a sound.

He waited thirty seconds. A minute. Checked the rest of the visible lot. Another figure near the Kroger entrance, just inside the shadow of the broken windows. A man, sitting on the ground with his legs extended, not moving except for the slow turn of his head — left, right, left, the mechanical tracking of inputs that weren't there. And further back, near the edge of the lot where it met the access road: two more. Standing together, which didn't mean together — they didn't cluster by choice, they clustered by proximity, by whatever residual signal had drawn them both to the same thirty feet of asphalt.

Four visible. In one parking lot. In one block of one town.

Shores moved south, away from the Kroger, keeping the parked cars between him and the lot. His route to Culver Road was residential from here — cut through the backyard of the old Beasley property, across the field behind the elementary school, then two blocks east. He'd walked it a thousand times as a kid. He could walk it with his eyes closed.

He couldn't walk it with his eyes closed.

Every house was a question. Every door, every window, every gap between fences. The elementary school parking lot had three cars in it and one of them had a figure in the passenger seat — visible through the windshield, the head moving in the slow oscillation, the hands working against the dashboard. Shores went around the far side of the building, through the playground, past the swing set where the chains hung still in the dead air. A tennis shoe on the ground near the slide. Child-sized. He didn't look at it longer than the scan required.

Culver Road. He came out between the Hendersons' house and the vacant lot that had been vacant since before he was born. The road stretched left and right — modest houses, ranch-style and split-level, the kind of street where everybody knew everybody's car and everybody's dog and everybody's business. His mother's house was four down on the right. Number 114. White siding, green shutters, the porch rail his mother had asked him to fix before he left for Knox and he'd said *I'll get it when I come back, Mom* and the rail was still sagging when he left.

He could see it from here. The porch. The rail, still sagging. The front door, closed. Tyler's parking spot in the driveway — the oil stain on the concrete, dark and familiar.

The truck was gone.

Something was on the porch of 118 — the Ramseys' house, two doors down. It was sitting in the porch chair the way Mrs. Ramsey sat in the porch chair every afternoon with her iced tea and her crossword. It was not Mrs. Ramsey anymore. Its hands were in its lap and its head was tilted and it was not looking at anything because looking required something that wasn't operating behind those eyes.

Shores moved along the hedge line. Quick, low, the rifle unslung now, the bayonet out. The thing on the Ramseys' porch didn't turn. He crossed the Ramseys' yard, then the Klines' yard, then his mother's.

The front door was closed. The screen door was latched. The garden hose was coiled on its hook beside the spigot, the way his mother kept it, the way she'd always kept it, because a coiled hose was a tended yard and a tended yard was a woman who had her life in order regardless of what the rest of the world was doing.

He tried the front door. Locked. His key was in his pack — he found it, the single house key on the Army keyring he'd bought at the PX his first week at Fort Knox, the keyring that said ARMY in block letters because he'd been eighteen and proud of it. The key turned. The deadbolt drew back. He pushed the door open.

The smell hit him. Not the Knox odor — something closer, something specific to this house, to the closed-up heat and the still air and the thing that was living in the back bedroom. The sweet, thick, wrong smell that meant a body had been in an enclosed space for days.

The living room was the way it always was. The couch, the TV, the afghan his mother crocheted two winters ago draped over the armrest. The remote on the coffee table. A glass of water, half-empty, a ring of mineral stain where the water level had been higher. Family photos on the wall above the couch — Kenny at eight, gap-toothed, holding a fish. Tyler's basketball team, freshman year. The three of them at Tyler's middle school graduation, his mother in the middle, an arm around each son. No father in any of them. The absence was the frame.

He could hear it.

Down the hallway. His mother's bedroom. Not a sound, exactly — a shifting. The creak of the bed frame, the faint friction of fabric against fabric, the weight of a body moving against sheets it had been lying in for days. The movement had no rhythm. No pattern. Just the occasional adjustment of a thing that was no longer sleeping and no longer still and no longer anything except what the dying had left behind.

The bedroom door was closed. The knob was the kind with the push-button lock — the simple privacy latch that every interior door in the house had, the kind you could open from the outside with a penny or a pin or a butter knife.

Tyler had locked it.

Tyler had been here. Tyler had watched their mother get sick — the flu, the summer flu that was going through town, the one the news said was under control before the news stopped saying anything. She'd gotten worse. She'd died. And Tyler — seventeen, alone, his brother at Knox and the phones dead and no one coming — had locked her bedroom door because Tyler understood what happened next. Because by the time she died, everybody in Elizabethtown understood what happened next.

Shores stood in the hallway with his hand on the doorknob and the lock between him and his mother. The hallway was dim. The photos on the wall beside him were the same photos that had been there since he was twelve — school pictures, the Sears portrait they'd sat for when Mom got the coupon, a snapshot of Tyler on his first bicycle with Kenny running beside him holding the seat.

He knelt. The lock was the same lock he'd learned to pick when he was ten and Tyler was seven and the trick was a bobby pin from the bathroom drawer. His mother had caught him doing it and hadn't been angry — she'd been impressed, in the way she got impressed, which was a single raised eyebrow and the words *well, at least one of you is handy.* He'd taught Tyler the same trick a year later. Brothers.

His hands were steady. The bobby pin was in his pack's side pocket — he carried one, the way you carry things from your old life without thinking about why. He worked it into the hole above the knob. Felt for the catch. The mechanism was simple and familiar and the familiarity was the worst part because his hands remembered this as a game, as a dare, as the small rebellion of a kid who wanted into his brother's room.

The lock turned. The latch released. He pushed the door open.

---

The sink in the kitchen didn't work. He tried the handle and got a thin, brown trickle that sputtered and died within seconds — the municipal water gone, the pressure lost, the infrastructure that had delivered water to 114 Culver Road for forty years finally empty.

He washed his hands with what came out. It wasn't enough. The blood was in the creases of his knuckles, under his fingernails, in the lines of his palms. His mother's blood, or the thing that had been in her blood after, and the water thinned it to a rust-colored smear but didn't take it away. He scrubbed with a dish towel — the yellow one with the sunflowers, the one she'd bought at the church bazaar — and the scrubbing didn't take it away either.

His hands. They'd done what they'd done. The towel couldn't fix that.

The bayonet was on the kitchen counter. He'd cleaned it before he cleaned himself — training, muscle memory, the order of operations that cared for the weapon before the operator. The blade was clean. The handle was clean. The thing it had done was between the blade and the door at the end of the hallway, which was closed again because he'd closed it, because leaving it open was not something he could do.

He stood at the kitchen counter with his palms flat on the Formica and his breathing wrong and the house around him doing the thing empty houses do — creaking, settling, the refrigerator compressor cycling on because the power was still running from somewhere, and the sound of the compressor was so ordinary and so wrong that it bent something in his chest that he didn't have a name for.

She'd been making lunch. The evidence was on the counter: a loaf of bread, the twist-tie still on, the first three slices gone. A jar of peanut butter, lid off. A butter knife in the sink with peanut butter dried on the blade. She'd been making a sandwich and she'd gotten too sick to finish it and the bread was still on the counter and the sandwich was never going to be made and Kenny Shores was twenty years old and standing in his mother's kitchen looking at a jar of Jif and his hands wouldn't stop shaking.

He closed his eyes. Let the shaking run. It wasn't going to stop because he told it to stop and he'd learned that much from the road, from the convoy, from the last two weeks — the body did what it was going to do and you waited and then you moved.

He moved.

Tyler's room.

The door was open — Tyler hadn't locked his own door. Inside, the evidence of departure. Dresser drawers pulled out, one of them hanging crooked where it had been yanked too hard. The closet door open, hangers shoved to one side, half the clothes missing. The backpack that usually hung on the hook behind the door was gone. His sneakers — the good ones, the Nikes he'd saved up for — were gone. The other pair, the beat-up Reeboks he wore for yard work, were on the floor beside the bed.

Posters on the wall: Nirvana, the University of Kentucky Wildcats, a Sports Illustrated cover that had been there so long the tape was yellow. Tyler's desk had a textbook open on it — biology, the chapter on cellular respiration — and a spiral notebook with half a page of notes in Tyler's handwriting, the letters getting bigger toward the bottom of the page the way they did when Tyler was bored or distracted or both.

The room of a boy who'd packed in a hurry. Not ransacked. Not panicked. The specific mess of a teenager who knew he was leaving and grabbed what mattered and left what didn't. Clothes. Backpack. The good sneakers. Gone.

Shores stood in the doorway. The room smelled like Tyler — deodorant and dirty laundry and the particular staleness of a seventeen-year-old's space. It was the most alive-smelling room in the house.

He went to the front window. The driveway. The oil stain — dark, familiar, the shape of the engine that had dripped onto that concrete every day for two years since Tyler bought the truck with money from his summer job at the hardware store. An '84 Ford Ranger, tan, rust around the wheel wells, an engine that Tyler understood the way some people understood music — by ear, by feel, by the relationship between the sound it made and the sound it was supposed to make.

The stain was there. The truck was not.

Tyler packed. Tyler took his truck. Tyler drove.

The logic was simple and the simple was the only thing holding him up. If Tyler was here when Mom got sick, Tyler had stayed. Tyler had handled it — locked the door, done the thing that needed doing without anyone there to tell him how. And then Tyler had packed a bag and gotten in his truck and left because staying was not an option and Tyler was smart enough, practical enough, *Shores* enough to know it.

If Tyler left, Tyler drove. If Tyler drove, Tyler was somewhere.

*He's somewhere. He got out. He's out there.*

Shores stood at the window with his forehead against the glass and the thought was not a thought but a rope and he held it because the alternative to holding it was a place he could feel at the edges of his mind — the dark, quiet, logical place where the math said: *your mother is dead and your brother is gone and you are alone in a house full of ghosts and the rifle is right there.* The place where the simple math turned on him and said the simplest thing of all.

No. Tyler was out there. Tyler needed his brother. Tyler was seventeen and alone and driving and he needed his brother to find him, and that was enough. That was the whole equation. Kenny Shores was going to walk out of this house and find his brother because that's what Shores men did. They showed up. Even when they couldn't call first.

He went back to the kitchen. Filled his canteen from a gallon jug of water he found under the sink — his mother kept emergency water there, had kept it since the ice storm of '89 knocked out power for three days. Took what food he could carry: two cans of soup, a sleeve of crackers, a bag of peanuts from the pantry. Put them in his pack.

The photo was on the wall in the living room. The Sears portrait — the three of them, Kenny in the middle because he was tallest by then, Tyler on the left grinning too wide because the photographer had said something dumb and Tyler always laughed at dumb jokes, and his mother on the right with her hand on Tyler's shoulder and the expression she had in every photo, which was not quite a smile but the composed, steady look of a woman who had gotten the three of them to the portrait studio on time and dressed properly and that was accomplishment enough.

He took it off the wall. Worked the back of the frame open and slid the photo out. Folded it once, carefully, along a line that didn't cross any of their faces. Put it in his breast pocket.

He left through the back door.

He did not go back down the hallway.

---

The south side of Elizabethtown thinned out the way small towns thin — the houses spacing further apart, the lots getting bigger, the pavement giving way to gravel shoulders and drainage ditches and the scrubby tree line that meant the edge of development. Route 62 ran south from here, a two-lane state road that wound through Hodgenville and into the rural stretch between here and the Tennessee line. Shores didn't know what was in that direction. He didn't know what was in any direction. South was the way the road pointed from where he'd come out of the neighborhood, and the road was the only plan he had.

He'd been walking for ten minutes when he saw them.

Two. On the road shoulder, fifty feet ahead, between him and the bridge over Valley Creek. They weren't together — not in the way that word meant. They were in the same place the way debris collects in the same eddy, drawn by whatever residual current moved through the world they inhabited. One was standing. One was on the ground, crawling — not injured, not impaired, but crawling because crawling was what the body was doing when whatever drove it last lost the pattern for walking.

The standing one was a man. Big — heavy-set, work boots, a John Deere cap still on his head. He was facing the bridge, swaying in the small, constant oscillation that they all had, the body searching for balance with a system that couldn't find it. His hands were at his sides and his fingers were moving, opening and closing, the way fingers move in sleep when the dreaming brain sends signals to muscles that don't know the dream isn't real.

The one on the ground was harder to see. Smaller. Moving south, toward him, but slowly — the crawl was labored, dragging, one arm reaching forward and pulling while the legs pushed without coordination. It was wearing a flannel shirt and jeans and its face was against the asphalt and it was leaving a dark smear behind it like a trail.

Shores stopped. Assessed. The bridge was the only way across Valley Creek without adding two miles to go around. The road was two lanes with no shoulder on the bridge itself — concrete barriers on both sides, no room to maneuver if something went wrong. If he went onto the bridge with these two between him and the other side, he'd be boxed. If he tried to go around, the detour would take him back toward the denser part of town.

Through. He had to go through.

The rifle came off his shoulder. He fixed the bayonet — the click of the lug seating was quiet but it was a sound and both figures reacted. The standing one's head turned. Not toward him — toward the sound, the general direction, the way a satellite dish pivots to acquire a signal. The crawling one paused. Its head lifted from the asphalt, the neck bending at an angle that wasn't pain because pain required the system that processed pain and that system was gone.

"Okay," Shores said. Under his breath, barely a whisper, the word escaping before he could stop it. The habit of a kid who'd talked himself through everything — tests, arguments, the first time he'd fired a rifle at basic. "Okay. Come on, Kenny. Go."

He moved fast. The crawling one first because it was closer and on the ground and the ground was where you dealt with the ones you could deal with. He drove the bayonet down into the base of the skull — the brainstem, the only thing that mattered — and the blade went in with a resistance that was not like anything the training dummies had prepared him for and then a give that was worse. The body went flat. Still. The fingers stopped moving.

He pulled the blade free and the standing one was turning. Faster than the crawl, slower than a person — the heavy body pivoting on legs that didn't bend right, the arms coming up, the John Deere cap somehow still on his head and the absurdity of that was a thing Shores's mind tried to do something with and couldn't because there wasn't time and there wasn't room for absurdity and there wasn't anything except the man coming toward him and the bayonet and the distance closing.

Shores set his feet. The training was there — the stance, the grip, the mechanics of a thrust that started in the hips and drove through the shoulders and ended at the point. He drove the bayonet forward and it caught the man in the throat, which was wrong, too high, the angle off because the man was taller than him and Shores was tired and scared and the thrust that had been clean on the dummy was ugly on the thing that used to be a person.

The man didn't stop. The blade in his throat was not information his body could process as a reason to stop. His hands found Shores's pack strap — thick fingers closing on the nylon with a grip that was not strong in the way a living person's grip was strong but persistent in the way a machine is persistent, the input received, the response engaged, no override available.

Shores wrenched sideways. The pack strap held. The bayonet was stuck — the blade lodged in cartilage or vertebra, the handle slick in his hands. He let go. Released the rifle. The man was still gripping his pack strap and the rifle was hanging from the man's throat by the bayonet and Shores was being pulled forward, off-balance, his boots skidding on the asphalt.

He got his hands on the rifle stock. Twisted it. The bayonet tore free with a sound he would hear for the rest of his life and the man staggered but didn't fall and Shores swung the stock into the side of his head. The impact traveled up through the rifle and into his arms and shoulders and the man's cap finally came off and the man went sideways, one knee buckling, and Shores hit him again. The temple. Harder. The swing coming from somewhere below his training, below his muscle memory, from the place where the twenty-year-old who'd put his mother down an hour ago kept the thing that was going to keep him alive because his brother was out there and alive was the only option that led to Tyler.

The man went down. The sound of the body hitting asphalt was heavy and final and Shores stood over him with the rifle shaking in his hands and his breathing filling the world.

He waited. The road was quiet. The bridge ahead was clear. The creek below it moved south, the water low and brown, the sound of it the only natural sound in the world.

Nothing came. Nobody else. The noise hadn't carried, or it had carried and what heard it was too far away to matter. This time.

He sat down on the road. Not a decision — his legs quit and he sat. The rifle across his knees, the bayonet dark with blood, his hands gripping the stock because gripping was the only thing his hands knew how to do right now. His breathing was too fast and he couldn't slow it and the shaking was everywhere — hands, arms, the muscles in his thighs jumping under the skin.

He sat there for two minutes. Maybe three. The sun was on his neck and the sweat was in his eyes and the smell was the smell and the bodies were on the road near him and he was alive.

"Okay," he said again. Whispered. To no one. To Tyler. "Okay."

He got up.

---

The truck was a quarter mile past the bridge.

A Chevy, mid-'80s. Dark blue, the paint oxidized to a chalky gray on the hood and roof. A work truck — tool box bolted to the bed, a coil of wire behind the cab, mud flaps with the chrome silhouettes that people put on mud flaps. It was stopped on the shoulder with the driver's door closed and the engine off and the windows down.

The driver was still in it.

He was belted in. The lap belt across his waist, the shoulder strap across his chest, his hands on the steering wheel at ten and two. His head was tilted forward, chin almost to his chest, and his hands were working the wheel — a slow, repetitive turning, left and right, the motion of driving reproduced without the engine or the road or the reason. He was wearing a flannel shirt and Dickies work pants and boots caked with dried mud and he could have been anyone's father, anyone's neighbor, the man who came to fix your furnace or deliver your firewood.

He'd been leaving. The evidence was in the truck — a duffel bag in the passenger seat, packed. A cooler on the floor behind the seat, the kind you'd fill with sandwiches and drinks for a long drive. Two gallon jugs of water behind the cooler. He'd packed and gotten in and buckled up and driven and somewhere between the driveway and wherever he was going, he'd stopped.

The fuel gauge was visible through the window. Full. He'd filled the tank. He'd done everything right.

Shores stood at the driver's door. The man's hands turned the wheel. Left. Right. The rhythm of it was the most mechanical thing Shores had seen all day — not the milling of the others, not the swaying, but this specific repetition, the body performing its last conscious act on a loop, the way a record skips on the last groove.

He opened the door. Reached across the man — the smell was close and specific and he held his breath and his hands did not shake because he told them not to, not yet, he could shake later, after — and pressed the belt release. The belt retracted. The man's body shifted toward the open door, the weight following gravity, the hands still gripping the wheel. Shores took his arm, pulled him out. The hands didn't let go of the wheel until the angle forced them to, the fingers releasing one at a time.

The body went onto the shoulder. Shores laid him in the grass beside the road because the asphalt was hot and laying a man on hot asphalt was a thing he couldn't do regardless of what the man had become. He didn't look at the face.

He got in the truck. The seat was warm. The rearview mirror was angled for a man taller than him and he adjusted it and the adjustment was so ordinary that it stopped him for a second — the small, human act of fixing a mirror, the thing you do without thinking when you get into someone else's vehicle, and the vehicle still smelled like the man's aftershave and there was a pine tree air freshener hanging from the mirror and a photo clipped to the visor of a woman and a dog.

He turned the key. The engine caught on the first try — a 350 small block, the sound unmistakable, the reliable rumble of a Chevy that had been maintained by someone who understood that maintenance was what you did for the things you depended on. The gauges lit. Fuel: full. Temperature: normal. Oil pressure: good.

The first thing that had gone right all day.

He put the truck in drive. Checked the mirrors. Pulled onto the road. South. The road went south and so did he, because south was where the road went and the road was the only thing in the world right now that had a direction and a direction was what he needed more than anything except his brother.

The sun was past center, afternoon now, the shadows starting to lean east. The road was two lanes, no center line, the blacktop scarred and patched and humming under the Chevy's tires. Trees on both sides. No houses. No mailboxes. No one.

His hands were on the wheel. They were shaking again — the adrenaline burned off, the body returning to the state that the body was going to be in for a while, which was the state of a twenty-year-old who had done the things he'd done today. The shaking was in his fingers and his wrists and the wheel absorbed it the way the truck absorbed the road, with the indifference of a machine that didn't care who was driving it as long as someone was.

He didn't check the rearview.

In his breast pocket, the photo. Three faces. His mother in the middle, her hand on Tyler's shoulder, the look that wasn't quite a smile. Kenny on the other side, sixteen in the picture, grinning because he'd always grinned, because grinning was what his face did before the world taught it the other things a face could do.

Tyler was out there. Tyler had packed a bag and taken his truck and driven, and the direction didn't matter because Tyler was seventeen and smart and practical and a Shores and Shores men got out. Shores men showed up. Even when there was no one left to call first.

Kenny Shores drove south. The road went on.

The shaking didn't stop. He didn't need it to. He just needed the wheel and the road and the engine and the direction, and the direction was forward, and forward was enough.
